But out of them all, the one that topped the list by a huge mile is the Bloodline storyline. Shane McMahon’s son, Declan McMahon wants to have a storyline like Roman Reigns’ faction in WWE.</p><p>Starting from Jey Uso, up until LA Knight feuding with The Bloodline, the story has felt like cinema. Now a little bit more spice has been added as recently The Viper, Randy Orton has also mentioned that he has some unfinished business with the faction. With all this going on, during a recent interview with Jim Varsallone, <a href=#>the son of Shane McMahon</a> has opened up about a future in WWE and believes that he and his brothers can have a similar storyline.</p><p>“We definitely could. My brother, Kenyon, he’s got a knack [for pro wrestling] in the sense that he’s super physical such a great athlete. You’ll see it in his high school football tape. He’s also doing wrestling in the winter. He’s just a great athlete. And my other brother, Rogan, too … he’s younger right now but he’s a pretty big boy. He’s gonna be really big someday. We’ll see — obviously, in the WWE, it’s all about storylines. Maybe we can have a Bloodline storyline with us. The possibilities are endless,” Declan McMahon said.

Obviously being in Florida, Florida is one of the best places to live with state tax and everything but the Performance Center is gorgeous. The weight room in there is amazing, obviously, they got a ton of rings and it’s just great because obviously when you’re wrestling, it’s not only about how you look, it’s how safe you can be and how you can protect who you’re in the ring with.</p><p>“So, I think they do a phenomenal job in sense of just learning the ring because what you see, there’s countless hours that those guys put in just making sure that everything’s going to go according to plan. I think the performance center does a really great job and it’s a work of art,” Declan McMahon said.
