As a result, she attended the University of California to earn her bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts. She later honed her skills at Yale University’s School of Drama, where she earned a master of fine arts degree.</p><p>Aja was credited in over 27 films and TV shows before 2021, including Emily Owens M.D. (2013), Black Box (2014), Sylvie’s Love (2020), The 24th (2020), and many more.</p><h2><span id=Father_Boyfriend_and_Husband_of_Aja_Naomi_King>Father, Boyfriend, and Husband of Aja Naomi King</span></h2><p>Aja Naomi King kept her personal life private. Fans hoped that she would finally reveal the name of her boyfriend or husband in 2021 when she was expecting her baby (after two miscarriages), but Aja remained tight-lipped.</p><p>So we took matters into our own hands and went in search of her baby’s father. According to HITC, Aja was rumored to be dating fellow How to Get Away With Murder star Alfred Enoch in 2017. However, neither of the co-stars admitted to dating each other, nor did they deny it.</p><p>Aja and Alfred have posted about each other several times in the past, according to further speculation. They did, however, come to a halt after a certain period of time. So, the question remains whether Alfred was ever Aja’s boyfriend and whether they were still dating at the time Aja became pregnant. If that’s the case, Alfred is almost certainly the father.</p><p>Aside from social media posts, Aja and her friends protested at the Women’s March. They even got together with her family in the United Kingdom. Alfred even accompanied Aja to the Essence Black Women in Hollywood gala.</p><p>If you’re unfamiliar with Alfred Enoch, he’s a British actor best known for his portrayal of “Dean Thomas” in seven of the popular Harry Potter films. You may also recognize him as “Wes” from How to Get Away with Murder. He is four years Aja’s junior.</p><p>Aside from Alfred, many people were perplexed as to whether Jack Falahee could be Aja’s boyfriend, as they were rumored to be dating at the time. But allow us to burst your bubble: No, Jack was not Aja’s boyfriend. Because he was in a relationship with Ellie Satter at the time.</p><p>As a result, Alfred Enoch is now Aja’s possible baby father and boyfriend. Aja announced the birth of her first child on Instagram on June 6, 2021. She did not, however, reveal any information about her newborn children, such as the name, gender, or date of birth.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Kurt Benkert- Bio, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend</a></h3>Kurt Benkert plays football professionally in the American National Football League (NFL) (NFL).
