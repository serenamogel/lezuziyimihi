There are a lot of trucks, so I narrowed it down to &nbsp;just the ones we think are the very best…</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id=more-7488></span><br>East Side King</a><br></strong>Paul Qui’s asian street food trucks will make you feel like you’re not in Texas anymore. Each truck has a different menu so we like to do these food-crawl style&nbsp;(3 of them are all on east 6th). So many of my favorite ingredients… miso, bonito, kewpie. Be still, my heart.</p><p><strong>location:</strong> many, check out their website<br><strong>what to order:</strong>&nbsp;anything, you can’t really go wrong.<br><strong>when to go:</strong> late night, (or anytime at their brick & mortar South Lamar location)<br>(picture 4 above: avocado bun with spicy mayo, crispy shallots, cilantro and green onion)</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lulu B’s</a><br></strong>Vietnamese sandwich truck. Jack would eat one every day if he could.</p><p><strong>location:</strong> South Lamar & Oltorf<br><strong>what to order:</strong> Lemongrass Tofu (or Pork), either in the ban mi or on noodles<br><strong>when to go:</strong> lunch</p><p><strong>UPDATE – NO LONGER A TRUCK. BRICK AND MORTAR.<br></strong>3632 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><br>Dock & Roll</a><br></strong>We initially questioned the idea of lobster from a truck too… but their lobster rolls are amazing. Try it, believe it. We spend quite a few Sunday afternoons here.</p><p><strong>location: </strong>South 1st and Elizabeth<strong><br>what to order:</strong>&nbsp;the “Maine” Event (the lobster roll – pictured above)<br><strong>when to go:</strong> lunch</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucky’s Puccias</a><br></strong>Italian flatbread sandwiches. They bake the bread to order in a wood-burning oven inside the truck.</p><p><strong>location:</strong> near 5th and Lamar, across from Whole Foods, within the Tiniest Bar in Texas<br><strong>what to order:</strong> I get the Puccia Vegetariana which is made with avocado, fontina and artichoke pesto. We haven’t tried the Puccia Nutella… maybe one day when we’ve been extra good.<br><strong>when to go:</strong>&nbsp;lunch or dinner, check hours before you go</p><p><strong>UPDATE – NO LONGER A TRUCK. BRICK AND MORTAR.<br></strong>1611 W 5th St #175, Austin, TX 78703</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><br>Kebabalicious</a><br></strong>Before food trucks were a thing, this truck was here. I don’t think many things in life are worth waiting in line for, but I waited one whole hour for a falafel wrap last weekend at the kite fest and did not regret it. The bread is fresh baked daily from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenicia</a>, and the sauces, including the tzatziki are to die for.</p><p><strong>what to order:</strong> the Falafel<br><strong>location:</strong> check the website, they move often<br><strong>when to go:</strong> late night, or in the afternoon during festivals.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><br>The Peached Tortilla</a><br></strong>Pad Thai taco, Bahn Mi sliders… need I say more? It’s interesting food in fairly small bites so you can try a bunch of things. I just noticed a “pulled” squash bbq taco with roasted spaghetti squash and&nbsp; peach bbq sauce that’s new(er) on the menu that I’ll have to go try.</p><p><strong>location:</strong>&nbsp;changes often, check their website<br><strong>what to order:</strong> whatever strikes your fancy<br><strong>when to go</strong><strong>:</strong> 11:30am – 2:30am during sxsw</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><br>Burro Cheese Kitchen</a><br></strong>This one’s technically not a truck, but a shipping container with a nicely designed seating space and good typography. Oh, and the grilled cheeses are good too. Choose your own cheese (choice of 9, most are local), bread, and spread.</p><p><strong>location: </strong>South Congress<strong><br></strong><strong>what to order:</strong> whatever you want, but our favorite so far was the Redneck Cheddar on beer bread (made fresh from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Easy Tiger</a>), with balsamic apricot fig spread.<br><strong>when to go:</strong> lunch</p><p>(note that trucks frequently change hours & locations, be sure to check with each before you go. Many only take cash, some only take credit card).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVflsK0wMinZJ%2Bnn5l6tb7UnKKsZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
