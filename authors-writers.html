With artist Jack Kirby, Lee launched the superhero team the Fantastic Four in 1961 and was soon responsible for creating popular characters like Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Hulk and Thor. Lee later worked in a number of comic-related business and multimedia ventures.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Stan Lee was born Stanley Martin Lieber on December 28, 1922, in New York City to Romanian immigrants Celia and Jack Lieber. With part of his childhood spent during the Great Depression, Lieber and his younger brother, Larry, watched his parents struggle to make ends meet for the family.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lieber, who later shortened his name to "Lee" as a writer, went on to be hired as an office assistant at Timely Comics in 1939 and became an interim editor for the company in the early 1940s. Lee also served domestically in the Army during World War II, working as a writer and illustrator.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Co-creating the Fantastic Four</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the early 1960s, Lee was called upon by his boss to create a series for Marvel Comics (Timely's new name) that could compete with rival DC Comics' hit title Justice League of America. Citing writing influences like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/arthur-conan-doyle data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sir Arthur Conan Doyle" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/jules-verne data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jules Verne" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jules Verne</a>, and following the encouragement of his wife, Joan, Lee did away with some of the usual superhero conventions. Hence, with artist and co-creator Jack Kirby, the Fantastic Four was born in 1961.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Hulk, Spider-Man and More Join Marvel's Lineup</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following the success of the Fantastic Four, a slew of new characters soon sprung from Lee and his Marvel cohorts, including the Hulk, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Daredevil and the X-Men.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lee was particularly known for his dynamism with copy and for imbuing his characters with a sense of humanity, tackling real-world issues like bigotry and drug use, which would influence comics for decades. An outgoing, humorous showman, he also developed a number of slogans as part of his shtick, including a Latin-derived call to rise, "Excelsior!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Marvel Comics became a highly popular franchise, and Stan Lee was promoted to editorial director and publisher in 1972. He later moved to the West Coast to be involved in Marvel's film ventures and eventually became chairman emeritus.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Shepherding the Rise of a Blockbuster Industry</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lee has become involved in a variety of multimedia projects while also serving as an ambassador for Marvel, even though he has filed lawsuits against the company and been the subject of debate over appropriate compensation for comic creators. The writer has seen Marvel develop into an entity that has inspired blockbuster film entertainment like the Iron Man, X-Men, Thor and The Avengers franchises.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lee started an intellectual-property company called POW! Entertainment in 2001 and the following year published his autobiography, Excelsior! The Amazing Life of Stan Lee. Later in the decade he received a Medal of Arts honor from President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/george-w-bush data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George W.

Bush</a> and launched the History Channel show Stan Lee's Superhumans, a series that looked at people with remarkable skills and abilities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">2012 saw more new ventures. Lee co-wrote a graphic novel, Romeo and Juliet: The War, which landed on The New York Times' best-seller list and launched a YouTube channel, Stan Lee's World of Heroes, which features comics, comedy and sci-fi content. At the end of the year, the ever-active Lee turned 90.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Health Problems, Legal Battles & Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lee endured the loss of his wife of nearly 70 years, Joan, in July 2017. He then gave fans a scare when he checked into a hospital for an irregular heartbeat and shortness of breath the following January. However, the comic book titan was discharged shortly afterward and announced he was ready to resume a full schedule with the latest Marvel feature, Black Panther, soon to be released.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although things seemed to be humming along nicely for Lee and the Marvel universe, an April 2018 feature in The Hollywood Reporter painted a far different story. According to the publication, Lee's daughter J.C. and other insiders were engaged in a battle over care of the 95-year-old and the future of his estate, the sides pitting Lee against one another and inducing him to dismiss formerly trusted associates. The piece also described J.C.'s tempestuous relationship with Lee, including an incident in which she physically assaulted both of her elderly parents.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lee died on November 12, 2018 in Los Angeles, California.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Videos</h2><ul data-node-id=29 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Stan Lee</li><li>Birth Year: 1922</li><li>Birth date: December 28, 1922</li><li>Birth State: New York</li><li>Birth City: New York</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Stan Lee was a revered comic-book creator who co-launched superheroes like the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange and the X-Men for Marvel Comics.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Television</li><li>Writing and Publishing</li><li>Film</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Capricorn</li><li>Death Year: 2018</li><li>Death date: November 12, 2018</li><li>Death State: California</li><li>Death City: Los Angeles</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=32><ul data-node-id=34 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Stan Lee Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/stan-lee</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: December 13, 2019</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=37 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>As far as I'm concerned, a really great comic-book story is every bit as creative and important as a great story done in any other form of the media.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYrqyYpL%2B0edaroK2doqh8tMDAp2SlnZU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
