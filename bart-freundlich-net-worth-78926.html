When casting Moore's character, Mia, Freundlich explains that he “was looking for someone who had a lot of complication, a lot of sadness under the surface, and betrayed very, very little of it in her face.” During filming, Freundlich recalls seeing Moore standing outside, exposed to the elements without a coat: "I came up to her and stood with my back to the wind. I didn’t want her to be cold, and I also didn’t want to put my arm around her, or smother her, because I didn’t know her that well...Even though I couldn’t have articulated it then, I understood that I could keep her warm up to a point. But then the rest was going to be for her to do. We connected in that moment on an unspoken level, where she knew I saw that flame in her, and understood it, and was willing not to suffocate it but to protect it.” They married on August 23, 2003. The couple have a son, Caleb (born December 4, 1997) and a daughter, Liv Helen (born April 11, 2002). Moore has appeared in all of Freundlich's feature films with the exception of <i>Catch That Kid</i> (2004), <i>The Rebound</i> (2009), and <i>Wolves</i> (2017).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeSlr%2B1ecWrnK6mlKG2pLSMp5ytZaekv7W0jHBvcmpm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
