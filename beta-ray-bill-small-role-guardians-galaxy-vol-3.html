One character who’s been conspicuous by their absence, though, is Beta Ray Bill, a fan favourite ally of the hero’s from the comics.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>The horse-faced Korbinite alien, known for dressing like the God of Thunder and having his own version of Mjolnir, has been teased in the MCU before, of course, but to date, we’ve yet to properly meet him. And while there’s still no firm confirmation that he’ll be showing up in Phase 4, evidence continues to mount that that’s when he’ll make his debut.</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=847 data-injectable=true>A few months back, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source close to We Got This Covered revealed</a> that&nbsp;James Gunn’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</strong></a> will formally introduce us to Beta Ray Bill, along with Quasar, another fan favorite from the comics who we’ve wanted to see up on the big screen for a while now. And though we don’t know how either of them will factor into the plot just yet, when it comes to the former at least, it sounds like he won’t have a large role.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/avengers-women-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/avengers-women-2.jpg><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>Trusted tipster The Marvel Scoopster took to Reddit this week to share a ton of information and among other things, he noted that while Beta Ray Bill will indeed be in&nbsp;Vol. 3, he won’t get a lot of screentime. He didn’t say how the character will cross paths with the Guardians or if he’ll return down the line in the MCU in a larger capacity, but it seems that his introduction in the threequel will be a quick one.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>If you ask us, we imagine <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&nbsp;</strong>won’t be the last we see of Beta Ray Bill. As mentioned above, he’s a hugely popular character and if we had to guess, his part in the pic will simply plant the seeds for him to show up again in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomZ6skWK%2FosWMm6ClpF2ouqK4y2apqKSVYrS2rdGdoJqmo2K0orjAsbBmrp%2BhenR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
