Blue Raspberry emerged as the group’s in-house female vocalist during the first round of Wu-Tang solo projects. She added vocals to tracks on Method Man’s Tical and Raekwon’s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, but seemed to have her position somewhat usurped by Tekitha on the Clan’s second album Wu-Tang Forever. Nevertheless, she has continued to appear on Wu projects including Method Man & Redman’s Blackout! and the Ghost Dog soundtrack. A solo album was in the works for 1999 and is known to have been completed but it was not released. Blue Raspberry finally debuted as a solo artist in 2005, releasing the album Out of the Blue through the website Chambermusik.com.
