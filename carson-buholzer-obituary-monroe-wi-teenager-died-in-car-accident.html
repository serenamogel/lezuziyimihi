The incident occurred near the state line between Wisconsin and Illinois.</p><p>A complaint of a collision involving a single vehicle was received at approximately 3:20 in the afternoon, and emergency personnel were summoned to the intersection of Theiler Road and Freeport Road in the neighborhood of Jefferson. The incident was reportedly caused by a car accident. Carson Buholzer, 17, was driving south on Freeport Road in his 2007 Subaru Impreza when the investigators say he lost control of his vehicle while attempting to negotiate a bend in the road. Before coming to a halt, the vehicle went off the road and into the ditch on the south side of the road, where it then collided with a tree.</p><p>Medical personnel who were present at the scene confirmed that Buholzer had passed away. The investigation into what caused the crash is still ongoing at this time. According to the local authorities, this is the seventh person to lose their life in Green County in 2018 as a direct result of an incident that was related to traffic.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwr8CrqqimXZfCqbvLs5yrZZ%2BXtrXBwKuwZqWfo7%2BwsYywoGaslZq7orPEq2SdoZWZeqq6jJyYq2WRmLCqsMSnq2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
