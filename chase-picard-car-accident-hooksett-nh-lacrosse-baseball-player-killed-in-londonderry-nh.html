The Picard Family and Chase have been an essential part of this league since its beginning ten years ago, and they need our help during this terrible time. A contribution to this cause would be much appreciated. Our thoughts are with Ashley, Jeremy, and the boys as they grapple with the unimaginable loss they have endured.</p><p>You can rely on the Hooksett Flag Community to help you! Chase was a kind, hardworking, and kind young guy who cared deeply for his parents and brothers. Athlete with exceptional talent. Baseball, basketball, and flag football were among his favorite sports. A significant portion of my evenings and weekends were spent attending sporting activities. Ashley has dedicated her entire life to caring for young children, as many of you are aware.</p><p>She has made a positive impact on many people’s lives and is always prepared to provide a helping hand to those in need. Jeremy is not only a well-known member of our community, but he also gives his time to coach his children in a number of sporting events. I frequently coach additional teams to ensure that young people in our community always have a team to play on. The death of a child is indescribable, and no parent should ever have to go through it.</p><p>We are all devastated by this awful loss and the premature death of a life. Please assist us in offering assistance to the Picard family during this terribly trying time. I’d like to thank everyone ahead of time.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwr8eaqp5loJ6wor7DZpqaql2WsKS1w56lrWWYpLysv8Stq2ammGK5oq%2FRqKqsnV2XrrSxwZqjpWWgoa66sdFmoqKknJqxbrXNZqOoppSku6Wx0auwZqaYZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
