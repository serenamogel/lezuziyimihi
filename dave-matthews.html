A self-taught musician, Matthews decided to assemble a band and put together a demo tape in 1990. Through college tours and grassroots marketing, the Dave Matthews Band developed a devoted following. In 1994, they released their major label debut, Under the Table and Dreaming, which went to No. 11 on the Billboard 200. The DMB followed with a string of chart-topping albums, including Everyday (2001) and Stand Up (2005).</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Musician and actor David John Matthews was born on January 9, 1967, in Johannesburg, South Africa. A self-taught musician, he and his family moved around the world throughout his childhood. When he was 2 years old, they moved to the New York suburb of Yorktown Heights, where Matthews' father, a physicist, worked for IBM. In 1977, Matthews' father died of lung cancer, and the family returned to Johannesburg to be with relatives.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To avoid South Africa's compulsory military service, Matthews moved back to the United States after high school, where he became a bartender at a jazz club in Charlottesville, Virginia, called Miller's. It was there that he began to dream about starting his own band.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The Dave Matthews Band Forms</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1990, Matthews decided to put together a demo tape and approached his favorite jazz musicians, sax player Leroi Moore and drummer Carter Beauford, to accompany him. For bass, he signed on Stefan Lessard, a 16-year-old local prodigy. Violinist Boyd Tinsley was recruited just weeks after the band formed. Early local gigs were an immediate success, and the band quickly developed a devoted following. The band's manager, Coran Capshaw, utilized grassroots marketing to move the band to the national stage. The group was known as the Dave Matthews Band.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">DMB Albums and Songs</h2><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Under the Table and Dreaming,' 'Crash'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Dave Matthews Band was soon playing at frat houses and beach clubs around the country. People began to make bootlegs of their shows and word of the band spread quickly among the college crowd. In 1994, the band released its major label debut, Under the Table dnd Dreaming, which went to No. 11 in the Billboard 200. The band's second album, Crash, was released two years later, debuting at No. 2. Though the album didn't receive as much critical praise, the band's follow-up concert sold out New York's Madison Square Garden in three hours.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Live at Red Rocks'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In October 1997, the band put out an official double-disc live album entitled Live at Red Rocks. Without any marketing or promotion, it debuted at No. 3, providing a high-quality and reasonably priced alternative to illegal live CDs that were beginning to flood the black market.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Before These Crowded Streets'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After taking some time off in 1997, the Dave Matthews Band went back into the studio to record Before These Crowded Streets (1998), which debuted at No. 1. The next album was repeatedly delayed before the band announced, in 2000, that they would be scrapping it and parting ways with producer Steve Lillywhite. Although Matthews felt that the music sounded tired and the band needed fresh input, it was an amicable break-up.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Everyday,' 'Busted Stuff,' 'Stand Up'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">They hired Glen Ballard, who had worked with Alanis Morissette and Aerosmith, a few months later. Their next album, Everyday (2001), lived up to its promise. The following year, Busted Stuff delivered a smoother, jazzier sound and a similarly successful debut. Their 2005 album, Stand Up, topped the Billboard charts in its first week.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Big Whiskey,' 'Away from the World,' 'Come Tomorrow'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Overcoming the death of founding member Moore in 2008, the DMB delivered their seventh studio effort, Big Whiskey & the GrooGrux King, in 2009, and followed with Away from the World in 2012. Loyal fans then endured a lengthy wait until the release of Come Tomorrow (2018), which became the group's seventh album to top the Billboard 200.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Solo Work and Collaborations</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Between gigs with his usual bandmates, Matthews put out a solo album, Some Devil, in 2003.
