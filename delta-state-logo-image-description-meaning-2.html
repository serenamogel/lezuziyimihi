The state is located in the South-South geo-political zone and has a population of over 4 million residents.</p><p>The capital of Delta state is Asaba which is located at the northern end of the state. Another major city in Delta State is Warri. This is known as the economic centre of the state and the city has the highest concentration of Delta state residents.</p><p>In this post, we’ll learn about the Delta state logo particularly with respect to the slogan embedded on it but first let’s take a quick look at the history of Delta state</p><p>Carved out of Bendel state in 1991, the formation of Delta state was a product of the agitations of ethnic groups like the Urhobos, Itsekiris, Isokos, Ijaws and the Ukwuani. As the name implies, Bendel was formed from the old Benin and Delta Provinces of Western Region-Delta to indicate the integration of Benin and Delta provinces.</p><p>Prior to the formation of Bendel state, Delta state was a part of the Mid Western state from 1963 to 1976. It would later become a part of Bendel state between 1976 and 1991.</p><p>The current Delta state is an ethnically diverse region but with four major linguistic stocks and seven languages between them.</p><p>The first region is made up of Anioma group. They are Igbo in origin and are composed of three main ethnic groups namely Enuani, who inhabit the Aniocha and Oshimili Local Government Areas. The other groups include Ika; and Ndokwa/Ukwuani and they can be found in the Delta North senatorial district.</p><p>The second region comprises the Edoid group which is made up of the Isoko and Urhobo as well as the Yoruboid group which consists of the Itsekiri and the Izon. The language of the Itsekiris is closely related to Yoruba however this language has also been culturally influenced by the Edo ethnic group from neighbouring Edo state. There’s also a blend of Urhobo, Ijaw and Portuguese in the Itsekiri culture.</p><p>Now that we’ve an idea of the history of Delta state, let’s take a look at the state’s slogan.</p><p>In October 2016, the Delta State Commissioner for Information, Mr Patrick Ukah announced that the Delta State Government had recently adopted a new slogan for the state. According to him, the new slogan, ‘Big Heart of the Nation’ was to replace the former one, ‘Finger of God’.</p><p>This new slogan is one of the changes that has been incorporated into the state’s framework alongside he popular 5 point agenda which Governor Ifeanyi Okowa outlined during his swearing-in. The 5 point agenda is encapsulated in the acronym SMART which means;</p><ul><li>Strategic Wealth creation projects and provision of jobs for all Deltans;</li><li>Meaningful peace building platforms aimed at political and social harmony;</li><li>Agricultural reforms and accelerated industrialization;</li><li>Relevant Health and Education policies;</li><li>Transformed environment through urban renewal</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyVocGiedKtmK2dXaG8qLuMoqSan5Visaa%2FwqugqayZpLtuucSapaKml2J%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
