He changed his German last name to the more pronounceable "Benedict," allegedly after eating eggs benedict at a restaurant.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During his years at Whitman College in Washington state, Benedict discovered his passion for acting. On a dare, he tried out for the musical production of Showboat and nabbed the lead role. He continued performing in theater and traveled to Michigan and Seattle, working on productions of King Lear, Ensign Pulver, Misalliance and Star-Spangled Girl.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Benedict eventually found his way to New York and performed on Broadway in Abelard and Heloise, opposite Diana Rigg and Keith Michell, and in Butterflies Are Free, opposite Gloria Swanson.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Viewing himself as a theater actor first and foremost, Benedict happened to stumble into film and television. "All I ever wanted to be was a stage actor," he said. "Someone put me on television because they saw me on stage."</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Movies and TV Shows</h2><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Hawaii Five-O,' 'Charlie's Angels,' 'Georgia, Georgia'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Some of Benedict's earlier television roles included Hawaii Five-O, Chopper One and Charlie's Angels. He made his big screen debut in Georgia, Georgia (1972), a drama co-starring actress Diana Sands, which was shot in Sweden and written by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/maya-angelou data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Maya Angelou" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Maya Angelou</a>. A year later, he was cast in the horror flick Sssssss (1973), and followed it up with the thriller W (1974), in which he played a mentally deranged abusive husband to Twiggy, who co-starred as his wife.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Battlestar Galactica,' 'The A-Team'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Benedict's career breakthrough came in 1978 when he was cast as the carefree, womanizing starfighter pilot Lieutenant Starbuck on the TV show Battlestar Galactica. He took his career even further when he was given yet another womanizing character to play — Lt. Templeton "Faceman" Peck on the 1980s hit show The A-Team — in which he gained international fame.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Criticism of Reimagined 'Battlestar Galactica' and Cameo in 'The A-Team' Movie</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When the revamped version of Battlestar Galactica came out in 2004, with his role recast for a female actress, Benedict showed no qualms in expressing his disappointment. He wrote a scathing online essay, entitled "Lost in Castration":</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"There was a time — I know I was there — when men were men, women were women and sometimes a cigar was just a good smoke," he wrote. "But 40 years of feminism have taken their toll. The war against masculinity has been won. Everything has turned into its opposite, so that what was once flirting and smoking is now sexual harassment and criminal. And everyone is more lonely and miserable as a result."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He added: "Witness the 're-imagined' Battlestar Galactica. It's bleak, miserable, despairing, angry and confused. Which is to say, it reflects, in microcosm, the complete change in the politics and mores of today's world as opposed to the world of yesterday."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite not being enthusiastic about The A-Team getting a reboot in 2010 as well, Benedict still agreed to make a cameo appearance (post-credits) in the movie, which starred <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/bradley-cooper data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bradley Cooper" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bradley Cooper</a> as the new "Faceman."</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Celebrity Big Brother' and Books</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Outside of his two most notable shows, Benedict steadily worked in theater, television and film, predominantly in the '80s and '90s. Some of his popular credits include appearances in The Love Boat, Murder She Wrote, Baywatch and Walker, Texas Ranger. In 2007 Benedict found time to dabble in reality television, appearing on the U.K.'s reality competition show Celebrity Big Brother. He has also branched out into writing and directing, as well as authoring two books: Confessions of a Kamikaze Cowboy and And Then We Went Fishing.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Wife and Sons</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Benedict was married to actress Toni Hudson from 1986 to 1995. The couple had two sons, and in 1998, he discovered he had another son from an earlier relationship.</p><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 1945</li><li>Birth date: March 1, 1945</li><li>Birth State: Montana</li><li>Birth City: Sulphur Springs</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Dirk Benedict is an actor best known for his roles on 'The A-Team' and 'Battlestar Galactica.'</li><li>Astrological Sign: Pisces</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=28><ul data-node-id=30 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Dirk Benedict Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actors/dirk-benedict</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: July 10, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: June 20, 2019</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwsMiromaalaOypbXCrQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
