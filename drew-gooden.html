Who is Drew Gooden’s wife?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Drew Gooden has been famous for a hot minute now.</p><p>The US comedian got his start as a sketch comedy artist on now-defunct Vine before making a successful transition to YouTube.</p><p>The guy who found his footing online poking fun at everything from rich people’s real estate listings to life hacks and YouTubers—of which he is definitely one—has toured the US with <a href=#>Danny Gonzalez</a> and <a href=#>Kurtis Conner</a> and had amassed 3.61 million subscribers on the giant video streaming platform.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the outspoken comic talent, Drew Gooden—and how he deals when he finds himself in hot water.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><p>Drew Gooden was born on the 26th of October 1993 in Orlando, Florida.</p><p>The Sunshine State native is the son of Chris and Beth Gooden, and he’s got two siblings—older sister, Kasey, and younger brother, Jake.</p><p>Drew’s parents eventually split up, with Chris marrying Cathy Benson several years later.</p><p>Growing up, Gooden played little league baseball, but he didn’t pursue the sport as an adult. Instead, he was going viral on Vine as an adult.</p><p>He posted his first video on Vine in May of 2013—a comedy piece called If You’re Serious About Mayonnaise.</p><p>While he wouldn’t start posting consistently for another couple of years, this was his first foray as an influencer.</p><h2><strong>Wife</strong></h2><p>In 2015, a photographer named Amanda Murphy commented on one of Gooden’s Vine videos.</p><p>The pair got to talking, even though Murphy lived thousands of miles away.</p><p>One thing led to another, and Gooden announced their engagement on Twitter in October 2016.</p><p>“Last April, a girl commented on one of my vines. She lived 2000 miles away. Now we are engaged & live in the same house. All because of @vine.”</p><p>Amanda and Drew Gooden tied the knot in 2019, and Drew wished “Happy Birthday to my marriage” on Twitter on March 11th, 2020.</p><h2><strong>Climbing Sky High</strong></h2><p><br>Following Gooden’s first few casual videos on Vine, he started doing comedy sketches.</p><p>One of those sketches, where he coined the trademark phrase “Uh, yeah, I sure hope it does,’ in response to a road work ahead sign, gained more than 10 million loops on Vine.</p><p>Gooden appeared in Karyn Spencer and Jeremy Cabalona’s Camp Unplug and steadily gained fame on the six-second video platform until it was shut down by Twitter.</p><p>So, what’s a Vine-famous influencer to do when he finds himself suddenly out of a platform?</p><p>In Drew’s case: make a successful transition to the “next big thing.”</p><p>By 2021, it was safe to say Drew had done that—he was nearing 3 million subscribers on YouTube and had crossed over to Instagram, too.</p><p>While Drew has certainly done well in the crossover—something that isn’t so easy for all the stars of old platforms—he explained in an interview that it wasn’t a straightforward transition for him.</p><p>“I waited until Vine died, and then a few months went by, and I was like, ‘OK, I guess I’ll try (YouTube).”</p><p>He also acknowledged that YouTube has done a lot more for him since he never made money directly from Vine.</p><p>He also notes that YouTube users also want to get to know influencers as people—instead of just wanting to be entertained—and so he’s learned to share himself, as opposed to just creating characters and acting out roles.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>What is the net worth of Wranglerstar</a>?</p><h2><strong>Road Work Ahead</strong></h2><p><br>Ironically, Gooden points out that his viral Road Work Ahead video—the one that people associate with him—wasn’t even that big a deal at the time.</p><p>He puts that down to it, featuring heavily in Vine compilations on YouTube.</p><p>When he attended VidCon recently, everyone wanted him to re-enact the Vine video for their Snapchat videos.</p><h2><strong>In Hot Water</strong></h2><p>In 2021, Gooden found himself out in the cold over an old tweet that resurfaced online.</p><p>The tweet, which Gooden had deleted not long after he’d posted it, made fun of Asian people.</p><p>Fans of Gooden had sent him messages about the tweet after its reemergence, and he posted a video response on Twitter to address it.</p><p>After explaining that the joke—which he’d made in 2016—wasn’t funny, didn’t make sense, and was “just two offensive stereotypes back to back,” he issued a heartfelt apology to the Asian community as a whole, and to his Asian fans.</p><p>His apology, which has been praised for being genuine and displaying self-awareness, was accompanied by a $5,000 donation to three different charities created to support the Asian community in the US.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>L.A.
