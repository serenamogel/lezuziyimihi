He became determined to ease his father’s hardships. At 10 years of age, he used to buy candies from a local store and sell them to his schoolmates at a higher price. After doing this for a few days, Fahim asked his father to buy him a jewelry-making kit as a gift for his birthday. Using the jewelry-making kit, he used to make beaded bracelets and necklaces and then sell them in his neighborhood playground. This was his second business. Later, he learned about the internet and taught himself how to do computer programming. At 12 years of age, he created his first website by using the programming language. He soon discovered that he could also make money by creating websites. Therefore, he created a number of online projects and started earning a significant amount of money. Pranks and surprises were a major part of his hobbies. While still studying in high school, he started a prankster website, prankdial.com, through which users could initiate prank calls to people. Prankdial had earned him more than $10 million till 2018.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Prankdial-founder-Fahim-Saleh.jpeg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-53153 class=wp-caption-text>Prankdial founder Fahim Saleh</p><p>In 2015, he launched Pathao, a digital platform that provides on-demand vehicle sharing, food delivery, logistics, and payment services.

While Pathao showed hockey stick growth, Masha's gaming company teetered along. But I and fellow investors always believed in his authenticity and hard work. We kept his dream going. In 2019 it has certainly paid off. Two top 10 games generating huge revenue.
