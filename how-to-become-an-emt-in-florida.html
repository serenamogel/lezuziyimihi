In <b>Florida</b>, <b>paramedic training</b> programs will usually <b>be a</b> minimum of 1100 hours.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-live-off-of-a-paramedic-salary></span>Can you live off of a paramedic salary?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>EMTs and <b>Paramedics can live off</b> the <b>salary</b> they make. However, the lifestyle they <b>can live</b> will depend on location, experience, employer, and overtime hours.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-are-paramedics-paid-so-little></span>Why are paramedics paid so little?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>There are other reasons <b>EMS</b> pay is <b>so low</b>. Certification is minimal — it only takes 120 to 150 hours of training to become an <b>EMT</b> (<b>paramedics</b> require significantly more). Ambulances in rural communities are often staffed by volunteers, which depresses wages for those who do pursue the role as a career.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-disqualifies-you-from-being-a-paramedic></span>What disqualifies you from being a paramedic?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>You</b> can be <b>disqualified</b> from <b>being an EMT</b> or <b>Paramedic</b> due to a criminal record (DUI, felonies, violent crimes), substance abuse, or not <b>being</b> able to perform the physical tasks required. The criteria for <b>being disqualified</b> from working as <b>an EMT</b> or <b>paramedic</b> can vary by state.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-i-be-a-paramedic-without-a-degree></span>Can I be a paramedic without a degree?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Student <b>Paramedic</b><p>Here’s how to <b>become</b> a <b>paramedic without</b> going to university: apply directly to the ambulance service as a trainee <b>paramedic</b> (known as Student <b>Paramedic</b>), and study while you work. The NHS offer work placements, and you <b>could</b> also volunteer with St John Ambulance.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-paramedic-a-good-career></span>Is paramedic a good career?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Becoming a <b>paramedic</b> can prove to be a highly rewarding and door-opening <b>career</b> path. <b>Paramedics</b> serve a vital role in healthcare because of their ability to show compassion, safely transport patients to a hospital, and provide first aid during medical emergencies.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-it-hard-to-get-hired-as-a-paramedic></span>Is it hard to get hired as a paramedic?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>With many 911 services, they are looking for <b>Paramedics</b>, so it may be <b>harder to find</b> a job as <b>an EMT</b>-B or I. <b>Jobs</b> are often very competitive, especially with high-profile services. If you’re looking to <b>make</b> lots of money, you’re looking at the wrong profession.

It the realization that you are it, you are the tippy top of the care ladder in that truck.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-is-paramedic-training></span>How long is paramedic training?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Paramedic</b> science <b>courses</b> usually take between three or four years full time and include a mixture of theory and practical work including placements with the ambulance services.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-study-to-be-a-paramedic-part-time></span>Can you study to be a paramedic part time?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Your <b>training</b> as a <b>paramedic</b><p>Approved full-<b>time</b> degree <b>courses</b> last for three years (<b>part</b>–<b>time courses</b> take up to five years). <b>Courses</b> combine university <b>study</b> with practical experience in ambulance services and hospitals.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whats-the-difference-between-a-paramedic-and-a-technician></span>What’s the difference between a paramedic and a technician?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Technicians</b> (or <b>EMT’s</b>) are able to perform immediate life support and basic interventions, they are also able to administer a small range of intramuscular and oral medication. <b>In</b> terms of events, <b>Technicians</b> are usually more than adequate. But for larger or more high-risk events, <b>paramedics</b> would usually be required.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-paramedics-make-more-than-nurses></span>Do paramedics make more than nurses?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Salary of a <b>Paramedic</b> and <b>Nurse</b>. The average salary for a registered <b>nurse</b> is $81,000, which is significantly higher <b>than</b> the $45,000 average salary earned by a <b>paramedic</b>, although that salary is about 20% <b>more than</b> what an <b>EMT</b> earns.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-ambulance-drivers-paramedics></span>Are ambulance drivers paramedics?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>To drive an <b>ambulance</b>, you’ll usually be a qualified <b>ambulance</b> care assistant/patient transport service <b>driver</b>, emergency care assistant, <b>ambulance</b> technician or <b>paramedic</b>.
