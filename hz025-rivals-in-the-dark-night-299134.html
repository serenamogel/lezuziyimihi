Not even Liko and Roy knew he had that, so I'm guessing he just coincidentally forgot to tell them, given his track record. I like how Friede basically told Amethio that he was never going all-out with him until now. Friede jumping off the tower and winking back at Liko and Roy was cool. Friede is a cool guy. I also noticed that Terapagos seemed interested/entranced when it saw Terastalization in action.</p><p>Onyx doesn't really leave an impression, but Sango DEFINITELY does. I really like her chaotic personality. She seems pretty unstable, especially when something upsets her. Her over-the-top reactions to Cap were both funny and unnerving. I wasn't expecting her to use Explosion, which definitely fits her impulsive nature.</p><p>Onia and Zirc get beat up almost instantly, but what else is new.</p><p>We get to find out the identities of the other Six Heroes. Lapras, Kleavor, and Entei. Kleavor is the most interesting, given the fact that it is an Hisuian Pokemon, which naturally raises the question where Lucius got it. The Ancient Poke Balls still seem much more advanced than the Poke Balls we see in Legends: Arceus. I wonder why they chose to give Lucius Entei of all Pokemon when he already has a Fire-type Legendary that happens to be part of a Fire/Water/Electric trio, they could of at least given Raikou some love given his almost nonexistent presence in the anime.</p><p>Diana reveals that the Explorers were friends of Lucius, which means that the Explorers are a lot older than I expected them to be. Unless Gibeon is somehow super, super old, he probably didn't create the organization himself, which makes me question why the admins seem so loyal to him specifically, seemingly much more than just an underling-boss relationship (I always keep going back to them saying they only exist to serve Gibeon). I wonder why the Explorers are going after Terapagos specifically, since they don't seem to have much interest in the other Six Heroes (and most are Legendaries) when they would likely know about them given their connection to Lucius. Then you have the fact that Terapagos was literally ECSTATIC to see Amethio, despite never meeting him before.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHypxo9rbGaqmauurb%2BMoqVmrJiaeqWt0aRkp6GXncFvfphyaGxsXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
