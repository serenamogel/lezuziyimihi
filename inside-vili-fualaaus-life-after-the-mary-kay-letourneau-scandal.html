Dr. Oz asked Fualaau what he would do if he found himself attracted to a minor, to which he replied that he would probably seek help. He also said that he never thought he would fall in love with someone more than 20 years his senior, but it happened. A source told <a href=#>People</a> that Fualaau gained perspective about his relationship after the separation. "He sees things clearly now, and realizes that this wasn't a healthy relationship from the start," the source revealed.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2021, Fualaau was arrested for a DUI. According to the <a href=#>New York Post</a>, he was caught in Seattle after almost crashing into a police car at 4 a.m. Fualaau was subjected to a sobriety test and was taken to the county jail.</p><p>In happier news, in 2022 Fualaau became a father for the third time. It's unclear who the mother is, but according to <a href=#>People</a>, one of his now-adult daughters with Letourneau announced the arrival of her new baby sister, Sophia, on her private Instagram page.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFknJobmxfnru0tcOeZK%2BhnJ56p8HApZiaraNiuaqyxGaYn6yVp3q1tMRmpJqqqWK4osWMpZytp6Wnu6at1GaqnJmema6tew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
