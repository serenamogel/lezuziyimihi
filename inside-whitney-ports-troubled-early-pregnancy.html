Whitney then asked her fans to "keep [their] fingers crossed" as she vowed to keep them updated on her "very much touch and go" pregnancy.</p><p>As for why the couple chose to spoke out, Whitney explained they made the news public because it's "such a huge part of [their] lives right now and it affects everything," noting, "I couldn't just sit here and go on with my life and not share it."

Speaking on the <a href=#>Infertile AF</a> podcast, she shared, "How [Tim] cared for me and how there he was, emotionally, for me was really amazing."</p><p>We're sending our best to Whitney and Tim.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb21ibYB4e8inqqKclWLEqbXTp5yyZaCkv7W%2FjK2pqK2SobKlecSaqaWxXaW%2FprPNmqWcsV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
