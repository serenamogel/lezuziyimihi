He is also the partial owner of a Camping World Truck Series racing team called Red Horse Racing. All of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Jeff Hammond? As of mid-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $5 million, mostly earned through a successful career related to NASCAR; he is referred to by Fox colleague <a href=#>Darrell Waltrip</a> as Hollywood Hammond. As he continues his career, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Jeff Hammond Net Worth $5 million</h3><p>Jeff attended North Mecklenburg High School, where he played American Football as a cornerback. He was named an All-American, and after matriculating, he then attended East Carolina University. However a career-ending injury stopped his football tracks in 1975.</p><p>Prior to his injury, he was already working as part of NASCAR as a tire changer and jackman. He served on a championship crew for three seasons alongside <a href=#>Cale Yarborough</a> and <a href=#>Darrell Waltrip</a>, before in 1982 becoming the crew chief at Junior Johnson Motorsports, helping Waltrip win his second consecutive championship. They became a driver-crew chief combination, and would win 43 races along with the 1985 Winston Cup Championship. His net worth increased significantly during this time.</p><p>Jeff subsequently followed <a href=#>Darrell</a> to Hendrick Motorsports, and they would win the 1989 Daytona 500. Two years later, the two formed <a href=#>Darrell Waltrip</a> Motorsports and they would win at Pocono Raceway, however, he would leave the team to work with Kenny Wallace in the 1993 season. He returned to Waltrip in 1996, but they were unable to achieve similar success compared to their run in the 1980s. Jeff then became Chad Little’s crew chief, and they found success. He stayed there until 2000, before becoming crew chief for <a href=#>Kurt Busch</a>, then going for a career in broadcasting.</p><p>In 2001, Jeff and Waltrip became broadcasters on the Fox Sports TV coverage of NASCAR, Hammond as an analyst for “NASCAR Race Hub”, and for Fox Sports 1, and from 2001 to 2013 for “Fox NASCAR Sunday” too. In 2014 he covered stories for NASCAR before commentating on the Sprint Cup Series and the Xfinity Series; he also co-hosted the Budweiser duel at Daytona. He was the co-host with Chris Myers in the pre-race shows until he was replaced by <a href=#>Michael Waltrip</a>.</p><p>Jeff also became the owner of Red Horse Racing’s Craftsman Truck program, winning 15 races with them. All of these opportunities helped his net worth increase.</p><p>Aside from NASCAR broadcasts, Jeff has also broadcast for TNA Wrestling when it was part of Fox Sports Net. He also has a column on Foxsports.com, to which fans can write with questions and he answers them in the column.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Jeff married Sharon in 198, but little else is known about their family.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=7.6658823529412><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 9, 1956</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Charlotte, North Carolina, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Commentator</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Sharon Hammond</td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/hollywoodjeff</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm4647938</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Sports Emmy Award for Outstanding Sports Personality -
