He furthered his education at the Bradley University.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jerry Krause career</h2><p>Krause joined the Baltimore Bullets as a scout after graduating from college. Krause established a reputation early on for his ability to recognize talent. Some claim that he found future Hall of Famer Earl Monroe.</p><p>During his time with the Bullets, Krause encouraged the team to select Phil Jackson, a forward from North Dakota, in the 1967 NBA selection. Although Krause was not drafted by the Bullets, he remained in contact with Jackson throughout his playing career and into his early coaching years.</p><p>They had a very successful partnership in the 1970s and 1980s. One time, Krause phoned Jackson while he was coaching the Albany Patroons in the Continental Basketball Association, and Jackson gave Krause a detailed study of the players in the league.</p><p>Following a few years in Baltimore, Krause spent the 1970s working as a scout for the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, Phoenix Suns, and Philadelphia 76ers.</p><p>Krause was a baseball scout as well. During the 1970s, he was employed by the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners, and Cleveland Indians.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/13163652/download-26-1024x718.jpeg><p>Krause continued to be a part-time Lakers scout when he was employed with the Mariners. He was involved as a White Sox scout in the signing of Ozzie Guillén and Kenny Williams, who would go on to win a World Series in 2005 as general manager and manager, respectively. Up until 1984, he worked as a White Sox scout.</p><p>Before the 1985–86 NBA season, Krause took over as general manager of the Chicago Bulls, succeeding Rod Thorn. Longtime buddy Tex Winter was his first hire with the Bulls.</p><p>Winter was employed by Krause as a bench coach assistant. Krause insisted that Winter teach the Triangle Offense to every Bulls player, but particularly to Michael Jordan.</p><p>As a college player at USC, Winter studied under former head coach Sam Barry, and he later successfully led Kansas State to the top spot using the triangle offense.</p><p>Doug Collins, the head coach at the time, was sacked by Krause and replaced by assistant coach Phil Jackson because Collins would not allow Winter to follow his instructions.</p><p>Krause left his position as general manager in 2003. The Bulls finished 23–59 the following season, and Krause’s hopes of building a young, athletic squad collapsed; in three years, every player he had acquired had been transferred or kicked out of the league.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/13163620/GettyImages-656496188.webp?resize=764%2C432&ssl=1"><p>Before signing with the New York Mets in 2005, Krause returned to his roots and served as a scout for the New York Yankees for a brief period of time.</p><p>He was a scout with the Chicago White Sox again in 2010; he had been a member of the team in the 1970s and 1980s.
