She is perhaps best known for her role in the television series “Sisters” aired on NBC for six seasons, from 1991 to 1996. She also previously married to <a href=#>Bruce Springsteen</a> and can be seen in his video “Glory Days”. Phillips has been active in the entertainment industry from 1982 to 2003.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Julianne Phillips? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the outright size of her wealth is as much as $30 million, as of the data presented in the middle of 2016. Modelling and acting are the main sources of Phillips net worth.</p><h3>Julianne Phillips Net Worth $30 Million</h3><p>To begin with, the girl was born in Chicago, Illinois but grew up in the suburb of Portland in Oregon on Lake Oswego, as daughter of the insurance broker William Phillips and his wife Ann Phillips. She was the youngest of six children raised in a Catholic family. Phillips graduated from Lake Oswego High School and Brooks College.</p><p>Talking about her professional career, she began modelling in Manhattan in the early 1980s. By 1982, she was represented by Elite Modelling Agency which characterized her as the perfect teenager package and benefited mostly around $2,000 per day. Then, she moved to Los Angeles where she got a small role in a music video which again gave her opportunities to appear as an actress in television movies “Summer Fantasy” (1984) and “His Mistress” (1984), the latter with <a href=#>Robert Urich</a>. She also appeared in <a href=#>Bruce Springsteen’s</a> music video “Glory Days”. She played with <a href=#>Chevy Chase</a> in the movie “Fletch Lives” in 1989. Two years later she began the role as Frankie Reed, the business oriented woman, one of the four main characters in the hit television series “Sisters” (1991 – 1996). It was her best known role. She left the television series one season before it was finished, though she participated in its very last episode. Since 1997, she has not created any significant roles except several brief returns to public.</p><p>Finally, the personal life of Phillips, although she was 11 years younger, she was finally best known as the girlfriend and later as the first wife of the famous musician <a href=#>Bruce Springsteen</a>. Phillips met him in the autumn of 1984 and they got married on Lake Oswego in the spring of 1985, surrounded by intense media attention. Due to differences in backgrounds and interests, their marriage did not last long. <a href=#>Springsteen’s</a> album “Tunnel of Love” (1987) described some of the unhappy feelings he had in the above mentioned relationship. During the subsequent concert tour “Tunnel of Love Express” he came close up to his backup singer <a href=#>Patti Scialfa</a> who also came from New Jersey. Media reported that Phillips found out about <a href=#>Springsteen’s</a> relationship with <a href=#>Scialfa</a> and Pillips had an opportunity to know about the affair by reading about its extensive coverage in the tabloids. However, as it was told in Dave Marsh’s book “Glory Days”, the couple had agreed to divorce after <a href=#>Springsteen’s</a> tour with “Tunnel of Love”. Currently, Julianne is single and lives in Los Angeles.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=13.735658914729><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Julianne Phillips</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$30 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 6, 1960</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Chicago, Illinois, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.73 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Model, Actress</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Lake Oswego High School, Brooks College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Bruce Springsteen (m. 1985–1989)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>William Phillips, Ann Phillips</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Julianne Smith</td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680541</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Movies</td><td>“Summer Fantasy” (1984), “His Mistress” (1984), "Big Bully" (1986), "Skin Deep" (1989)</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>TV Shows</td><td>"Glory Days” (1984, video), “Sisters” (1991-1996), "Fletch Lives" (1989), "Sweet Lies" (1988), "Intimate Portrait" (2001),, "Entertainment Weekly's "Today" (2014)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=2.5816733067729><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=1.4461538461538><td>1</td><td>Ex-sister-in-law of <a href=#>Pamela Springsteen</a> and Virginia Springsteen.</td></tr><tr readability=3.6243093922652><td>2</td><td><a href=#>Bruce Springsteen</a>'s "Tunnel of Love" album was released around the time his marriage to Julianne was breaking up.
