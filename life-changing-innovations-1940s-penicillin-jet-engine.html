Scuba was originally an acronym that stood for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus and although it was coined by Christian J. Lambertsen for his rebreather, it was French naval officer French engineer Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Emile Gagnan's 1943 invention, the Aqua-Lung, that would go down in history as the original scuba gear.</p><p dir=ltr>Cousteau was interested in underwater exploration, but diving bells and diving suits at the time allowed neither flexibility nor mobility. It wouldn't be until he met Gagnan, who had created a new valve for regulating gas flow, that the two of them were able to invent a new valve that allowed for underwater breathing, according to the <a href=#>National Inventors Hall of Fame</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>"The World's Oceans,"</a>&nbsp;edited by Rainer F. Buschmann and Lance Nolde, by 1948, Cousteau was using the Aqua-Lung along with scientists to launch the first underwater archeological expedition as they searched for the wreckage of Mahdia, a Roman ship that sank off the coast of Tunisia around the 1st century B.C.E. By the 1950s, the Aqua-Lung was available for purchase to the U.S. public, and its technology had revolutionized, if not outright created, the scuba industry. <a href=#>Lemelson-MIT</a> writes that the technology of the Aqua-Lung continues to be used as "part of virtually every set of modern SCUBA gear in the world."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kW9pcXFjZLmqssRmmqGZnpy2r7OMoqWnp6aWwaq7zaxkanFkZcBuvMSnoJyhnKG2r3nJnqtmnZ6ctq%2Bxjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
