"The Ultimatum: Queer Love" host JoAnna Garcia Swisher gave birth to Emerson Jay Swisher on May 21, 2013. She told <a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;that her Cuban-born OB-GYN father, Jay Garcia, after whom Emerson was named, played an important role in her birth. "He actually was present for my first delivery and caught my first baby," she said. Many years later, Emerson has her own passions and interests. She is a keen equestrian and participates in various competitive events.&nbsp;JoAnna shared a selfie of her and Emerson, <a href=#>noting</a>, "Living that horse show life these days."</p><p>Grandpa&nbsp;Jay was also in the delivery room when Sailor Stevie Swisher was born on June 28, 2016. In an <a href=#>Instagram</a> birthday tribute, JoAnna described Sailor as "The [crown emoji] of the one liner, with a heart of gold." Sailor isn't the only family member with a witty take on life. It seems as if Sailor may have inherited the trait from JoAnna's mom, Loraine Garcia.&nbsp; JoAnna&nbsp;<a href=#>wrote</a> that, before her mother died, "She still had moments that would make us gasp with laughter. Reminding us of the delicious witt [sic] and sass that brought us so much joy. She was the QUEEN of the one-liners. Always knowing when to throw one out to totally turn your day around." Even though both of JoAnna's parents have died, she still carries precious memories of them through her daughters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxkaYVyhI6mnJ6sXajEprHTZqSan56kuaqtjKyrmqpdn7yius2aZKCZopi2onnSsKCsoJWnerOxwKVkpaGWmnqstcOsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
