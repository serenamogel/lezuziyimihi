Mr. Trump definitely seemed to have a thing for her and she told me how he kept going on about how he liked her ‘pert nipples,’” Ransome wrote about her friend in one email,&nbsp;made public when the latest batch of newly unsealed documents dropped.</p><p>“I also know she had sexual relations with Trump at Jeffery’s NY mansion on regular occasions,” she added. &nbsp;</p><p>Ransome walked back the salacious allegations in an Oct. 23, 2016 email with&nbsp;Callahan, writing, “I would like to retract everything I have said to you and walk away from this,” according to the filing.&nbsp;</p><p>She added that “only bad things” and “pain for my family”&nbsp; would come from going public.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The documents are part of a since-settled defamation lawsuit that Jeffrey Epstein accuser&nbsp;Virginia Roberts Giuffre brought against the sicko’s madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, in 2015. <span class=credit>Patrick McMullan via Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 2019, Ransome&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted in a New Yorker article</a>&nbsp;that she “invented the tapes to draw attention to Epstein’s behaviour.”</p><p>Trump advisor Steven Cheung said in a statement Monday: “These baseless accusations have been fully retracted because they are simply false and have no merit.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Follow along with everything we’ve found out about Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.</strong></a></p><p>Clinton’s rep Angel Urena declined to comment on Monday.</p><p>A Virgin Group spokesperson told The Post: “We categorically reject all allegations made by Sarah Ransome … The allegations are baseless and unfounded.”</p><p>“The actions of Jeffrey Epstein were abhorrent and we support the right to justice for the many victims impacted by his abuse,” the rep concluded.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Epstein’s compound on Little St. James Island in the Caribbean is seen above. <span class=credit>SplashNews.com</span></figure><p>Ransome — who has been living abroad since at least 2017, and is now living in London — never produced the alleged sex tapes.</p><p>She didn’t immediately return a request for comment Monday.</p><h2 class=block-info-box__heading>What we know about the Jeffrey Epstein list of 170 associates</h2><ul><li>On Wednesday, documents were released naming 170 associates of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The list included Michael Jackson, <a href=#>magician David Copperfield</a>, Stephen Hawking, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and former President Bill Clinton — who an Epstein victim <a href=#>said “likes them young, referring to girls.”</a></li><li>Disgraced royal Prince Andrew, a known friend of Epstein, was named in the documents and was previously sued by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, who accused Andrew of sexual misconduct toward her. According to one royal family expert, the Firm <a href=#>“will stand beside” the Duke of York “no matter what.”</a></li><li>Epstein’s former attorney and friend Alan Dershowitz <a href=#>defended the late multimillionaire sex offender’s associates</a>, saying: “None of us knew about his private life that he kept so secret.” Dershowitz, who is on the list, added that no one should be automatically convicted in the court of public opinion simply for showing up in court documents.</li><li>Epstein’s brother, Mark Epstein, <a href=#>told The Post </a>that the ex-business mogul said he could have upended the 2016 election over what he knew about both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton: “Here’s a direct quote: ‘If I said what I know about both candidates, they’d have to cancel the election.’ That’s what Jeffrey told me in 2016.”</li><li>Only some of the 170 names and their relationships to Epstein have been released. The remainder of the documents will likely become public record throughout the next week.</li></ul><p><a href=#><strong>Keep up with The Post’s live blog on the revelations about Epstein’s associates revealed in the newly released documents here.</strong></a></p><p>The emails were filed in a since-settled defamation lawsuit case that Epstein accuser&nbsp;Virginia Giuffre — aka Virginia Roberts — had brought against the sicko’s madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, in 2015.</p><p>The messages were disclosed as former Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz’s lawyers sought to undermine Ransome’s claims, arguing that “she manifestly lacks credibility.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Epstein is seen above on his island in 2006. <span class=credit>SDNY</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Ghislaine Maxwell on Little St. James Island in 2006. <span class=credit>SDNY</span></figure><p>Dershowitz, Epstein’s one-time lawyer, had been accused by Giuffre of sexually abusing her in a lawsuit she has since dropped admitting she “may have made a mistake.”</p><p>In a letter to the judge at the time, Dershowitz’s legal team had argued that if Ransome’s deposition were to be made public, her emails should, too, because without the added context her “unrebutted testimony will gravely prejudice [Dershowitz] by publishing deliberate lies calculated to harm his reputation.”</p><p>“The deposition transcript standing alone leaves an incomplete and, thus, false impression of Ms. Ransome and her outrageous claims,” the letter read.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">An Epstein accuser claims the pedophile has sex tapes of Bill Clinton.</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The accuser also claims there are tapes of Richard Branson. <span class=credit>Nick Zonna/ipa-agency.net/Shutterstock</span></figure><p>“This court should not allow its power to enter and modify a protective order to be manipulated so as to authorize selective disclosure of de-contextualized materials. If the Ransome deposition is made public, the Emails must also be as well.”</p><p>The 17 documents — totaling&nbsp;327&nbsp;pages —&nbsp;released Monday, add to the avalanche of information&nbsp;that has emerged in recent days detailing how the late pedophile leveraged his connections to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rich, powerful, and famous</a>&nbsp;to recruit young girls and cover up his crimes.</p><p>In addition to high-profile names, the documents contain the accounts of some of Epstein’s teenage victims, as well as those who once worked for the late financier.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The accuser also claims there are tapes of Donald Trump. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">An unidentified accuser claimed that Prince Andrew engaged in an underage “orgy” on Little St. James, according to court documents. <span class=credit>REUTERS</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Sarah Ransome’s claims were included in the trove of documents. <span class=credit>SDNY</span></figure><p>Among the details to emerge in the newly unsealed docs released last week were alleged that&nbsp;Prince Andrew “spent weeks”&nbsp;at Epstein’s&nbsp;Palm Beach, Florida, mansion, where the disgraced royal would receive “daily” massages.</p><p>A&nbsp;girl, identified only as Jane Doe 3, also accused the Duke of York of engaging in an “orgy” with underage girls during one of his stays on Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean, according to a court filing.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmaXBfo7K4v46nnLBlkpbBpLSMqJ1mopWbs7Ox2GacqaukmravecKorKusXZm8pMHMnqWtq12Wv6Z50Z6jnpmjmrFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
