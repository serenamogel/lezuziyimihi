The Lightning acquired Klima in 1993 in exchange for potential future benefits.</p><p>Until 1996, Klma spent three seasons with the Lightning. He played with the Lumberjacks, Kings, Penguins, and Oilers during the 1996–97 campaign before being released in 1997.</p><p>In 1997–1998 he participated in the DEL, and in 1998 he tried to make a comeback with the Red Wings.</p><p>He left the NHL in 1999, played two seasons in the Czech league in 2001–2003, and then announced his permanent retirement in 2003. During those two years, he captained and played for Litvinov.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Klma responded with the number 85 in honor of the year of his defection and his debut season in the NHL when asked which jersey number he wanted to don.</p><p>Petr Klma, albeit one of Detroit’s more prominent stars in the late 1980s, was also a headache for the Red Wings’ administration.</p><p>On September 23, 1988, during training camp, Detroit suspended Bob Probert and Klma indefinitely for violating team rules, which brought the situation to a head. The Wings promised to move Klma at the time of the ban, but this never materialized.</p><p>The team added that until Klma had his drinking under control, it would not accept him back.
