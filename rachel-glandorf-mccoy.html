She’s the eldest child of her parents, Steve Glandorf and Liisa Glandorf. Besides her parents, McCoy has a younger brother named Josh Glandorf.</p><p>As for her ethnicity, Rachel is American, although her ethnic heritage is of white origin. Apart from that, she did not say any more about her family.</p><h2><span id=Early_Lives_and_Education>Early Lives and Education</span></h2><p>Born in Southern California, young Rachel went to Vail Christian High School in Colorado. While media attention is new to her, Rachel has always been a standout athlete at her high school. In the 2005 article, Vail Daily described Rachel as “easily the most accomplished athlete” in school history.</p><p>“Glandorf is easily Vail Christian’s most experienced athlete in the history of the young school. She’s been all-league in volleyball three times and turned the basketball trick four times. She took home bronze and silver in the 800s in the last two years on the 2A-1A state track in the spring.”<br>Added to that, she even played basketball and volleyball, but the track was her best sport. Even though basketball was originally her favorite sport, it has changed over the years. When asked, Glandorf said, and we quote,</p><p><strong>“I’m thinking that if I want to go to a larger school, I’m going to have to go on track. I can play basketball if I want to go to a smaller school. Let’s face it, I’m better off on the field than I’m in basketball.”</strong><br>Certainly enough, right after graduation, Rachel enrolled at Baylor University. She competed in the 400-meter hurdles, finishing fifth at the Dr. Pepper Invitational and ninth at the North Texas Invitational in 2007.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_and_Marriage-Rachel_Glandorf_McCoy_Colt_McCoy8217s_wife>Relationship and Marriage-Rachel Glandorf McCoy, Colt McCoy’s wife.</span></h2><p>As we know, Colt McCoy doesn’t need any introduction; he’s a loving husband and a caring father. They’ve been married for over a decade now, so where did their love story begin?</p><p>From what we hear, Rachel and Colt met in the summer of 2008 when Glandorf was an intern on KEYE TV in Austin. At the time, Colt had been the Longhorns starting quarterback.</p><p>Likewise, their first meeting was purely professional, where Rachel interviewed Colt for her channel. It was after the two of them met and began dating. Before they got married, Rachel spoke to the Dallas Morning News about their first meeting.</p><p>“I interviewed him a number of times before we finally walked out at the end of the summer. Originally, I was trying not to date him. I heard that he was a decent man. But you never know that.”<br>Then she spoke about their first date, and she said,</p><p>“On Date No. 1, Glandorf played cool: she brought a friend with her, to McCoy’s surprise. He wasn’t so pleased about that.”<br>Not to mention, the two kept their relationship strictly silent. It didn’t take a long time, though, for fans to find out their relationship. As soon as the game began, Rachel was seen sitting next to Colt’s parents and even watching TV.</p><h2><span id=When_did_they_marry_How_many_children_does_Rachel_have>When did they marry? How many children does Rachel have?</span></h2><p>It didn’t take long for Rachel and Colt to tie the knot right after their partnership got out. After two years of dating, the lovebirds became engaged on January 12, 2010. The same year, on 17 July, they agreed to make it official and exchanged their vows.</p><p>In the same way, their lovely wedding ceremony took place at the Church of Christ in Westover Hills. Approximately five hundred guests, including their family and friends, filled the location. Not to mention the actor, Aaron Watson, sang Jordan Shipley during the event with former Longhorns.</p><p>Also, the wedding featured some skeet shooting, an activity where Rachel excelled. Colt explained the shooting at the Alamo Bowl Press Conference in 2012.</p><p>“It was at our reception, we had our reception outside of Austin. At our wedding, we had a lot of guests, and that was part of the reception. If you were going to shoot skeet, you might. And when Rachel and I were there for the first time, we walked over there. She’s hit it, by the way. She’s hit it.”<br>Just this year, the duo celebrated its tenth anniversary and is looking forward to spending more years together. In addition, the beautiful couple is blessed with three beautiful children.</p><p>Rachel gave birth to her first child, Sloane, in 2015, followed by Brooke Lincoln a year later. Likewise, on July 10, 2018, Glandorf gave birth to his third child, a son.</p><p>Blessed and content, the little family is now living in their spacious home in Austin, Texas. Added to that, all of them still have to be rumors.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_this_Rachel_Glandorf_-The_age_and_the_height>How tall is this Rachel Glandorf? -The age and the height</span></h2><p>An athlete since her high school days, Rachel has always been fit, both physically and mentally. The former track and field member, Glandorf, stands at 5 feet 8 inches(173 cm) and weighs around 52 kgs(121 lbs).</p><p>Even though her track and field days are long over, she still keeps herself fit and healthy with appropriate diets and exercise regimes. Similarly, as a mother of three, Rachel also had a beautiful figure of 33-24-34 inches.</p><p>Added to that, Glandorf looks appealing with her long blonde hair and coffee-colored eyes.</p><p>Thinking about it, we find it hard to believe that Rachel is 33 years old. Yes, she was born on June 15, 1987, under the sun sign of Gemini. And people believe them to be free-spirited, out-going, and smart nonetheless.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Carer_and_Life>Professional Carer and Life</span></h2><p>During her high school and college days, Rachel was active as a professional track and field athlete. Also, a member of the track and field team, Vail Christina High School, even hailed her as the best athlete the school has seen.</p><p>The school was right to claim that since Rachel was all the rage. Glandorf earned all-state conference honors and even finished second in the state in 800 meters in her junior years.</p><p>Moreover, in her sophomore and senior seasons, Glandorf ran to 3rd place in the state. Not to mention, in her senior basketball season, she got named the Years Western Slope Sportsman.</p><p>After completing her high school and university education, Rachel started as a journalist. She was interning at the CBC affiliate KEYE 42-TV located in Austin, Texas. But after the marriage, it seems, Rachel has halted all her activities and stayed as a housewife.</p><p>Rachel Glandorf caused a minor panic in 2011<br>In 2011, a year after her marriage, Rachel made many Texas fans panic when she appeared on Colin Cowherd’s shows on ESPN Radio. There she was asked about the presence of boosters around the Longhorns’ program.</p><p>To this, she replied it was a culture, and many players were in no place to reject the boosters offering gifts. Soon her comments made fans panic as many speculate it might cause NCAA to force open an investigation into the program.</p><p>Even Yahoo! Sports Doug Farrar wrote about Rachel’s comments and what it could bring. According to Texas law, it is clear that all their players should take absolutely nothing from the boosters, even if it is a hot dog or soda.</p><p>Thankfully, the comments did not lead to an NCAA investigation, but they did prompt athletic director DeLoss Dodds to issue a statement proclaiming that Longhorns officials “take compliance very seriously.”</p><p>Net Worth and Income- How much money does Colt McCoy make a year?<br>The former track and field athlete, Rachel, later pursued her career as a journalist. From what we know, she has accumulated a net worth of $1 million so far. Also, Rachel brings in an annual salary of $50,000 under her name.</p><p>At the same time, her husband, Colt McCoy, has an astounding net worth of $5 million. Likewise, his annual salary is around $1.5 million. Colt McCoy is best known for being the quarterback in the National Football League(NFL) for the Washington Redskins.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto" class=mytable width=100%><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Rachel Glandorf McCoy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td>June 15, 1987</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Los Angeles, California, US</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Known as</strong></td><td>Rachel Glandorf McCoy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>Baylor University</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td>Steve Glandorf</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td>Liisa Glandorf</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Brother</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>33 years</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>5 feet 8 inches(173 cm)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>52 kgs(121 lbs)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoe Size</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Body Measurement</strong></td><td>33-24-34 inches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Build</strong></td><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Journalist</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Famous As</strong></td><td>Wife of Colt McCoy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Husband</strong></td><td>Colt McCoy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>Three</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$1 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td>$50k</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Merch of Colt McCoy</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Jersey</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Football Card</a></td></tr></tbody></table><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Comfort Tyler</a></h3>Comfort Tyler estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
