In the winter, I crack open a store-bought jar when I want to add roasted red peppers’ sweet, rich flavor to a pasta, dip, or soup. But in the summer, bell pepper season, I much prefer to make my own. Homemade roasted red peppers are sweeter and smokier than store-bought ones, and they’re not overly salty or briny either. They’re super easy to make, and they keep in the fridge for a week or more—perfect for punching up the flavor in whatever you’re cooking.

I’ve ordered fresh Vietnamese spring rolls countless times at restaurants, but if I think to snag a pack of rice paper wrappers at the store, I make my own at home.

It’s vibrant and colorful, crunchy and refreshing, made with red and green cabbage, crisp bell peppers, carrots, herbs, and toasty pepitas.

This excess water can cause the tofu to crumble when you cook it, and it will also have a hard time crisping up. But when you press tofu, you remove the excess moisture. It takes on a chewier, firmer texture, which makes it super satisfying to eat and less likely to fall apart. Pressed tofu guzzles up flavor from a sauce or marinade, and it gets SO…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It’s grilling season!
