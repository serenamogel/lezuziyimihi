Grinkov raised her, laid her down, and then took a single, clumsy step back.</p><p>Gordeeva asked him if he was okay, and he said that he was only a bit dizzy. According to Nardiello, Gordeeva helped her husband sit on the ice. After that, he passed out and became unconscious. Grinkov passed gone in a brief period.</p><h2><span id=Details_of_the_Sergei_Grinkov_autopsy_report>Details of the Sergei Grinkov autopsy report</span></h2><p>The autopsy revealed that Grinkov’s left anterior artery, which supplies a sizeable section of the heart muscle, was almost occluded.</p><p>Varga asserted that it was a matter of time whether he kept to any schedule. Unless his disease was diagnosed and he got a bypass, his chances of survival were minimal. In young people, sudden death is typically the earliest sign of coronary artery disease.</p><p>His heart was enlarged, as athletes’ hearts typically are, but due to his history of hypertension, it was disproportionately enlarged, which is more than one might anticipate for an athlete.</p><p>Varga claims that because sportsmen are so strong, they often conceal their injuries, and the primary issue is that guys don’t want to express their agony. No indications of using steroids or abusing any other drugs or alcohol, he insisted.</p><p>Varga stated that, except for this one problem, he appeared to be in good health. His front half and some of the left side of his heart muscle were oxygen-depleted.</p><h2><span id=Initial_Career_of_Grinkov_and_Gordeeva>Initial Career of Grinkov and Gordeeva</span></h2><p>Grinkov and Gordeeva won two Olympic gold medals and four world crowns in pairs figure skating. They were a classic, ballet-trained couple, and their skating was beautiful and reflective of their on-ice relationship.</p><p>Before taking the stage in the “Stars on Ice” performance, they started Monday with a regular drill at the Olympic ice arena.</p><p>Gordeeva and Grinkov, who competed for the Soviet Union, won four world championships (1986, 1987, 1989, 1990), as well as the Olympic gold medal in 1988, before turning professional in late 1990.</p><p>The duo was once again qualified to participate in the Olympics for the 1993–1994 campaign, and they went on to win another gold medal while representing Russia.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Kaylin Wiley, Averie Gilley, and Sophierosejm."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":56}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/kaylin-wiley/"}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":"https://popularbio.com/averie-gilley/"}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":"https://popularbio.com/sophierosejm/"}{"1":56}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Kaylin Wiley</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Averie Gilley</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sophierosejm</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Olympic pairs champion</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Stefanos Titsipas, A Tennis Player, Has Real Hair, Right?
