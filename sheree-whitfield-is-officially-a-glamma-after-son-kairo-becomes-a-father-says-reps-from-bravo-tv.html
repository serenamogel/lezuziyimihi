However, as she faces an unexpected health issue, she will have to shift all her focus. Will there be enough Sheree to go around?”&nbsp;</p><p>Fans were introduced to Whitfield and her son during the first season of “RHOA” back in 2008. Throughout his appearances, viewers watch Kairo finish high school and go off to attend the historically Black men’s institution Morehouse College.</p><p>As news about Whitefield’s status as a ‘Glamma,’ fans mentioned her beau Martell Holt and what she’s preparing to go through this season.</p><p>“Not this write up putting “stepping into greatness” and “suffering public humiliation” in one sentence to describe my girl Shereé and KAIRO HAD A BABY?! also sighhh not this Martell Holt guy — I read up on him and I’m scared for Shereé. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">#rhoa</a>.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not this write up putting “stepping into greatness” and “suffering public humiliation” in one sentence to describe my girl Shereé 😭 and KAIRO HAD A BABY?! 😯 also sighhh not this Martell Holt guy — I read up on him and I’m scared for Shereé. <a href=#>#rhoa</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/jIl1BNQbCA</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mxATesKDex</a></p>— Daily Bravo 💌 (@dailybravomail) <a href=#>March 31, 2023</a></figure><p>Another <a href=#>said</a>, “Kairo had a baby?? i feel so old but i know sheree will be motheringg this season.”</p><p>One of the most memorable on-screen moments with Kairo and his mother happened during the show’s ninth season. In one episode, the two had a discussion about the then 19-year-old after he was arrested for a DUI.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked to explain himself, Kairo admitted that he smoked pot earlier that day, but wasn’t under the influence while he was driving.&nbsp;</p><p>“He pulled me over for an expired tag, not for driving reckless or anything,” he said. “Then he pulled me out the car, he didn’t find anything in there.”</p><p>During their conversation, Whitfield became emotional as she expressed to her child how scared she was after receiving the phone call that her Black son had been taken into police custody.&nbsp;</p><p>“Anything could happen,” she told him. “And this is something you have to put in your head that as a Black young man, you’re not on the same playing field as a lot of people.
