And on a trip with Miami Beach’s South Beach in 1991, he found his haven.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“The mood is very, very easy,” he told the Miami Herald of the city in 1993, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/16/us/versace-fashion-innovator-slain-in-miami-beach.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The New York Times</a>. “That is special and I don't find the mood any place else in the world.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Unfortunately, it was there, in his happy place where he didn’t have any worries in the world, that Versace was killed by a gunman on the steps of his <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/gianni-versace-miami-mansion-casa-casuarina data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ocean Drive home" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ocean Drive home</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">On the morning of his murder, Versace took a morning stroll to his favorite newsstand</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was a morning like any other on July 15, 1997. Versace woke up in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/versaces-vision/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Casa Casuarina" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Casa Casuarina</a>, a 10-room, three-story 1930s Mediterranean-style mansion located at 1116 Ocean Drive, a quieter part of the popular Miami Beach road.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And he was looking for a little downtime.

Plus the Italy-America Chamber of Commerce was about to honor him as its Citizen of the Year in November.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">So he had come back to his Florida mansion to relax with his partner of 11 years, Antonio D’Amico. At around 8:30 a.m., Versace took a stroll — as he often did — to the News Cafe, located about 0.3 miles south at 800 Ocean Drive.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/16/us/versace-fashion-innovator-slain-in-miami-beach.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Simply clad" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Simply clad</a> in a white t-shirt, black shorts and sandals, Versace strolled down the street. It wasn’t unusual for the locals to see their world-famous neighbor out and about, enjoying their community. He often stopped by the cafe for magazines — and sometimes he’d splurge and get an orange juice.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On this particular morning, he spent about $15 on five magazines — Business Week, Entertainment Weekly, People, New Yorker and Vogue — and then headed back home, less than a 10-minute walk away.</p><img alt="Casa Casuarina" title="Casa Casuarina" width=3150 height=2074 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-53369016.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Dave Allocca/DMI/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span><p>Casa Casuarina</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A stranger shot Versace in broad daylight</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Versace got home and started opening the gates into his oasis. He hadn’t been gone long.

He shook a little bit and stopped moving.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Inside the gates, an ominous feeling immediately came over D’Amico. “I felt as if my blood had turned to ice,” he told the Observer, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/29/gianni-versace-murder-lover-slams-american-crime-story-ridiculous data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Guardian class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Guardian</a>. He and their butler jumped up. “The house had stained glass windows so we couldn’t see what had happened from inside, so we had to open the gate.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I saw Gianni lying on the steps, with blood around him,” D’Amico said. “At that point, everything went dark. I was pulled away, I didn’t see any more.”</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">His murder sent shockwaves around the globe</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Versace was quickly transported to Jackson Memorial Hospital’s Ryder Trauma Center in Miami, seven miles away. But by 9:15 am, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/16/us/versace-fashion-innovator-slain-in-miami-beach.html?auth=login-email&login=email" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he was pronounced dead" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he was pronounced dead</a> at the age of 50.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The shockwaves sent the world into a frenzy.

Later, the steps turned into a makeshift memorial, with flowers and cards left behind.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">From the other side of the globe, other big names of the fashion world sent their condolences. “The news of Gianni Versace's death has left me in a state of shock," <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/giorgio-armani data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Giorgio Armani" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Giorgio Armani</a> said, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/jul/16/versace-killed-gianni-fashion-miami data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Guardian class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Guardian</a>. “My reaction is one of revolt against such an unnatural and violent death.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“The shock of this tragedy devastates me,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/valentino data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Valentino Garavani" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Valentino Garavani</a> — best known as just Valentino — said, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.cnn.com/US/9707/15/versace.reax/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CNN class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">CNN</a>. “I can't believe he's not still with us.” Designer Gianfranco Ferre said, “There are no words to describe how I feel right now.

I feel only infinite pain.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While the fashion industry tried to make sense of the untimely death, the FBI was soon involved too. After all, this wasn’t the perpetrator’s first victim.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Versace was Andrew Cunanan’s fifth victim</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Described as “gay gigolo down on his luck” by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1997/09/cunanan199709 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vanity Fair</a>, 27-year-old <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/andrew-cunanan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Andrew Cunanan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Andrew Cunanan</a> was a Filipino Italian American raised in San Diego. Reportedly a high I.Q. genius who could rattle off detailed facts, thanks to a seemingly photographic memory, he lusted after the high life, often pursuing older wealthy men. With a penchant for reveling in half-truths, Cunan’s charms helped him weasel into the lifestyles of the rich, while leaving behind a trail of uncertainties.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One of the biggest questions marks left behind was whether Versace and Cunanan knew one another. Some sources claim that Cunanan met Versace in San Francisco years before the 1997 shooting, but the Versace family has been adamant that the two had never met.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But one thing’s for certain. Cunanan was on a rampage in the spring of 1997, with four murders between April 27 and May 9. The first was his supposed best friend Jeffrey Trail, 28, followed by his crush, David Madson, 33, in Minnesota. He then moved on to Chicago 75-year-old real estate businessman Lee Miglin. While some accounts claim Miglin was a client of Cunanan’s, the Miglin family says the patriarch most definitely hadn’t met his killer before that night.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Those three murders were called by criminologists as the work of a “pathological, sadistic sexual offender,” according to Vanity Fair, but his fourth victim, 45-year-old New Jerseyan William Reese, was thought to be simply killed for his red Chevrolet 1995 pickup truck.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The deadly spree had landed Cunanan a spot as one of the F.B.I.’s most wanted fugitives — not only were his killings sudden and sporadic, but they were gruesomely vicious.</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Cunanan seemed to be waiting for Versace to return to Miami</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While a couple of months had gone by, Cunanan had apparently been living in Miami since May 12 at Normandy Plaza, four miles away from the Versace mansion. He lived a sort of double life, dressing up and going out to enjoy the nightlife and then mostly just eating pizza. He’d also been seen buying books and pornographic magazines, according to Vanity Fair.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For the last five years, Versace spent about half his time at his Miami Beach home. And on Thursday, July 10, he returned. Two days later, Cunanan checked out of the Normandy Plaza — and on that Tuesday, he attacked.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Since he shot in such close range, eyewitnesses saw him running — and the clothes he was wearing were found by the red truck in a parking garage. Finally, on July 23, a police team honed in on a Miami area houseboat where he had been hiding out. There had been evidence he was trying to get a fake passport to leave the country. As the authorities approached, he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/25/us/at-end-of-cunanan-manhunt-suicide-and-mystery.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="shot himself dead" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">shot himself dead</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=40 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Versace’s death left a hole in the fashion world</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Without a suicide note, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.cnn.com/US/9712/30/versace.presser/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="no explanation" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">no explanation</a> for why Cunanan killed Versace — or how long he targeted him — was ever revealed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">About 2,000 mourners attended <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9707/22/versace.memorial/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Versace’s funeral" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Versace’s funeral</a> at Milan’s Gothic Roman Catholic church on July 22 — among them, high-profile names he worked with, including Campbell, Armani, John and Madonna. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/princess-diana data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess Diana" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Princess Diana</a>, in one of the last times she was seen before her August 31 death the following month, sat next to John.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To keep his legacy going, the family focused on his fashion empire.
