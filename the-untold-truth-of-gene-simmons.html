According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Inc.</a>, Simmons is worth a whopping $300 million, but don't think for a second that all that money comes from playing rock music in a costume. Kiss songs are popular, but they're not&nbsp;that&nbsp;popular. To supplement his income from his day job, the business-savvy Simmons is a serial entrepreneur who's operated, among other things, a sports team, a restaurant chain, and a financial company. He's also a successful author, reality show star, and even a business lecturer.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Simmons has also taken his business acumen to his mothership. As the man himself puts it, "I like being part of a rock and roll band, but I love being part of a rock and roll brand." In fact, the whole Kiss bad boy image is carefully cultivated to achieve precisely that, with remarkable success. The band's name has been licensed to a ridiculous 3,000 product categories&nbsp;â€” not products but product categories.&nbsp;From condoms to credit cards and lunch boxes, imagine a product, and there's a decent chance you can grab a Kiss-themed version of it. As a result, the Kiss brand is estimated to be worth nearly $1 billion. That's plenty of incentive to keep applying that greasepaint and climbing in those cumbersome boots.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9lXBpaWhfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2csq%2BxjKygpqWfo8Bw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
