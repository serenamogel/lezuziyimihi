These <a href=#>doctors</a> (and doctor’s wives) have made it big, with the luxurious lifestyles to prove it. But how much do they really earn?</p><p id=par-2_54>We don’t know exactly how much each main cast member earns for <a href=#>appearing on the show</a>. Nor do we know their exact salaries for their real-life jobs. But using information about <a href=#>average salaries</a> for different occupations, we can make an educated guess at what these ladies and their husbands are bringing home every year.</p><h2>Simone Whitmore</h2><ul><li><strong>Estimated salary: $300,000</strong></li></ul><p id=par-3_46>Dr. Simone is an obstetrician-gynecologist who owns her own Atlanta practice, North Perimeter OBGYN. Obstetrician-gynecologists earn an average of $286,000 per year, according to <a href=#>2017 survey by Medscape</a>. But because Dr. Simone is self-employed, she probably earns a bit more — $300,000 on average, per Medscape.</p><p id=par-4_25>Until recently, Dr. Simone was married to Cecil Whitmore, who is the director of enabling functions at Coca-Cola, but the pair recently filed for divorce.</p><h2>Jacqueline Walters</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/jacqueline-walters.jpg><ul><li><strong>Estimated salary: $286,000</strong></li></ul><p id=par-5_64><a href=#>Dr. Jackie</a> is also an obstetrician-gynecologist, and her patients include some other famous faces, like <a href=#>Toni Braxton</a>. Since she isn’t self-employed, we estimate her salary is a bit lower than Dr. Simone’s – around $286,000 a year. Fans also know that Dr. Jackie is a breast cancer survivor, and she’s the founder of the 50 Shades of Pink Foundation, which supports breast cancer patients.</p><p id=par-6_33>Dr. Jackie – who’s had marriage troubles of her own — is married to <a href=#>Curtis Berry</a>, a former pro basketball player. Currently, he’s a basketball coach at a private high school in Atlanta.</p><h2>Heavenly Kimes</h2><ul><li><strong>Estimated salary: $160,000</strong></li></ul><p id=par-7_55>Dr. Heavenly is a cosmetic dentist who owns her own practice, Smiles by Dr. Heavenly. Cosmetic dentists earn an average of $160,000 a year, <a href=#>according to Payscale</a>, but since Dr. Heavenly owns her own practice, she might earn more. She also previously several other dental practices and has launched her own teeth whitening product, SmileChangers.</p><p id=par-8_49>Dr. Heavenly is married to Dr. Damon Kimes, the chief medical officer at Roswell Pain and Weight Loss Specialists. Pain management physicians earn more than $240,000 a year, <a href=#>according to Payscale</a>. That means this couple is likely earning at least $400,000 a year – not counting their Bravo salaries.</p><h2>Quad Webb-Lunceford <strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Quad-Webb-Lunceford.jpg><ul><li><strong>Estimated salary: Unknown</strong></li></ul><p id=par-9_48>Quad Webb-Lunceford is a philanthropist and business owner. She owns Picture Perfect Pup, a line of “canine couture.” Previously, she was a medical sales representative. But she won’t be married to medicine for much longer. She recently filed for divorce from her husband, Dr. Gregory Lunceford, a psychiatrist.</p><h2>Toya Bush-Harris</h2><ul><li><strong>Husband’s estimated salary: $395,000</strong></li></ul><p id=par-10_39>Toya Bush-Harris is a stay-at-home wife and mother, so aside from whatever she earns for appearing on Married to Medicine, she’s likely not bringing in a paycheck. But her husband, Dr. Eugene Harris, an ER physician, earns big bucks.</p><p id=par-11_50>Emergency physicians in Georgia earn an average of $395,000 a year, according to the <a href=#>American College of Emergency Physicians</a>, the equivalent of $224 an hour. But that hasn’t kept the couple out of financial trouble. They spent the past couple of seasons paying back a $170,000 debt to the IRS.</p><h2>Mariah Huq</h2><ul><li><strong>Estimated salary: $210,568</strong></li></ul><p id=par-12_37>Mariah Huq isn’t just one of the stars of Married to Medicine. She’s also one of the show’s producers. <a href=#>Paysa estimates</a> that co-executive producers at FremantleMedia, which produces the show, earn an average of $210,568 a year.</p><p id=par-13_16>Her husband, Dr. Aydin Huq, is an emergency physician likely earning close to $400,000 a year.</p><h2>Contessa Metcalfe</h2><ul><li><strong>Estimated salary: $200,000+</strong></li></ul><p id=par-14_49>Dr. Contessa is the newest addition to the Married to Medicine cast. She’s a flight surgeon and owns a medical concierge service, Acute Face MD. The majority of concierge physicians earn more than $200,000 a year, according to <a href=#>Concierge Medicine Today</a>. She also owns a TCBY Frozen Yogurt franchise.</p><p id=par-15_25>Her husband, Scott, is a family medicine physician. These doctors earn an average of $225,000 a year, according to the <a href=#>American Academy of Family Physicians</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbXSZqCsZZikxG651JyfZqyYmnq0wMCrqmanlmK6or7RopydZaSkeq6xw6KaoqaVYrqit8RmoKdlopqurXnLop2eZpipuq17</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
