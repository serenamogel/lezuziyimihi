When it turned out Rowlet had accidentally brought a wind chime instead of fruit, Trumbeak gave it a scolding and sent it back out. The next day, as the Pikipek and Trumbeak were out looking for food, Toucannon was flashing back to the time when Rowlet's Egg hatched among the Pikipek when Rowlet returned with a melon.
