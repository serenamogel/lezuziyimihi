Later, it got delayed by a year, and the date of release was later confirmed to be June 9, 2023. The latest Transformers will be competing against some of the popular franchises like Spider-Man and The Flash, while it was revealed the movie is a sequel to the 2018 spin-off Bumblebee, which saw an expansion of the mythology set two decades before the 2007 opener.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>It is the seventh installment of the franchise, which is heavily inspired by the Transformers: Beast Wars cartoon, where most of the key characters were replaced by new heroes with similar characteristics and personality features. Here, Optimus Primal will lead the Maximals, and the voice will be provided by Ron Perlman.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>The key antagonist of the movie is Scourge, who will be leading the Terrorcons, a faction of the Pedacrons, the movie’s version of Decepticons, and viewers will get to hear the voice of the Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage as the big bad.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>Overall, the story will revolve around Anthony Ramos’ Noah, who committed some mistakes in the past and is searching for redemption. The other lead is Dominique Fishback’s Elena, a museum employee who is well-versed in artifacts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false>The first teaser trailer gives out a lot of information about the plot. The very first scene shows a gigantic gorilla onscreen who is none other than Optimus Primal, beating his chest in anger and despair.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>He is in conversation with the leader of the Autobots, Optimus Prime, who warns him about an imminent danger. “There’s a darkness coming,” says Primal — most possibly pointing to Scourge’s destructive plans. Based on the scene, there’s no wonder that Primal would take up one of the most important roles in the movie.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Immediately after the scene, we are treated to the sight of our Bumblebee, boasting a new design. We are then introduced to Ramos’ Noah, the Maximals’ human ally, alongside his confidant Mirage, voiced by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pete Davidson.</a></p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>Other Maximals such as Cheetor also make an appearance in the trailer, who is shown running past Bumblebee. There is a new female Autobot named Arcee who grabs onto a Volkswagon in motion to fight her enemies.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>Finally, the viewers are treated to a fight between Bumblebee and the Terrorcon leader and antagonist Scourge with a claw-shaped left hand, emanating fire. &nbsp;By the end of the trailer, we get to see Elena, along with Noah and Mirage.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>The movie contains an impressive cast. Three recognizable names will provide the voices for a trio of important characters. This includes Peter Cullen – who will resume his role as the voice of Optimus Prime, Perlman , and Dinklage.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>Other cast members include SNL star Davidson, Michelle Yeoh as Airazor, and Liza Koshi as Arcee, with Cristo Fernandez, John DiMaggio, David Sobolov, Tobe Nwigwe, and Michaela Jae Rodgriguez also supplying their vocal talents.</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>With the exciting trailer and phenomenal cast, there is rising excitement for Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6uZnqizsL7MnqmsZaKewKZ5zp9kraCVYq%2BmrdKtqmabkajBbr7EpZyaq5VisaLAxGarq5mZobKzec%2Blpq1lkaOxbrnOq5xo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
