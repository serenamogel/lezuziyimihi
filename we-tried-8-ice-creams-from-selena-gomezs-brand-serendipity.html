I was born and raised in the suburbs of New York City, but word of a decades-old restaurant called Serendipity3 never reached my nine-year-old ears. My colleagues, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justine Sterling</a>, did live in New York City as adult people and seem to be familiar with this place, which is apparently famous for something called Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, and is also now a grocery store dessert brand co-owned by pop singer and one-time Waverly Place Wizard Selena Gomez. This all also has something to do with the movie Serendipity with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, which I would rather pour acid into my eye sockets than ever watch again (except for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the part where John Corbett acts like a total dickhead playing the shehnai</a>; that I would gladly watch all day). Anyway, there’s a lot going on here.</p><p>I’m exhausted and I haven’t even talked about the ice cream yet—the actual reason for this article. Because, yes, there are pints of ice cream intended to channel the experience of eating a Serendipity sundae in the comfort of your home. I tried eight flavors—all while listening to John Corbett jam out on the shehnai—and here’s what I thought of them.</p><p><strong>Frrrozen Hot Chocolate</strong></p><p>Ultimately, I like the concept of frozen hot chocolate, and I definitely like the extremely thick swirl of sweet whipped cream that wends its way through this pint. But I did find it kind of grainy. None of the other ice creams in the line are grainy, so I have to assume it’s that way by design.</p><p><strong>Selena Gomez’s Cookies & Cream Remix</strong></p><p>It’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cookies and cream ice cream</a>—but it’s pink! The chocolate sandwich cookie chunks are big and plentiful, but the fudge swirl doesn’t make much of an impression.</p><p><strong>Unicorn Bliss Sundae</strong></p><p>This is fun—and very sweet. The blue vanilla ice cream tastes kind of cotton candy-esque and there’s a cookie swirl through the whole thing. I’d recommend letting this pint soften before you eat it so the cookie dough loosens a little.</p><p><strong>Friends Central Perk Coffee Almond Fudge</strong></p><p>I’m partial to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">coffee ice cream</a> and this tastes very good, particularly the dark chocolate-covered almond bits scattered throughout, which contribute a nice nuttiness—kinda like, Joey, amirite? (Sorry, I haven’t watched <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Friends</a> in a long time.)</p><p><strong>A Christmas Story Oh Fudge! Peppermint Cookie Fudge Sundae</strong></p><p>This is a pretty standard <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">peppermint ice cream</a>, but a fudge swirl makes it just a little more indulgent. I’d take this over a bar of Lifebuoy soap in the mouth any day.</p><p><strong>Forbidden Broadway Sundae</strong></p><p>I’ve never been to a Broadway show, but I have seen the 1980s commercial for CATS at the Winter Garden Theatre about a million times, so same diff! I have had a lot of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chocolate ice cream</a> in my life, and this is a very good chocolate ice cream—rich and flavorful. The best part of this pint is the smattering of brownie pieces in the mix. They’re super chewy and fudgy and I like it.</p><p><strong>Birthday Cake</strong></p><p>If you always wanted to straight-up eat a tube of that sparkly Bonne Bell Vanilla Frosting lip gloss, this pint is for you. It has a heavy cake-batter flavor and chunks of cake, too. Kids will like this a lot.</p><p><strong>Humble Pie</strong></p><p>This is goooood. Excellent, flavorful peanut butter ice cream with peanut butter swirls, chocolate chunks, and graham pieces. If I were Selena Gomez, I would have put my name on this one. Maybe John Corbett can claim it!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese SOUP DUMPLINGS?! | Sporked" title='Play video "Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese SOUP DUMPLINGS?! | Sporked"' rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgbDU7SGRaE&list=PLHbjKrchTZzsSSNxQfCn9JpW3evHOmxqK</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BVYsGztcSdZHFlmZiybq%2FRnpimq12bv7C5jKycpZ2elnqou8yesaxlkqeur7CMrJyrnZ6ZtrG107Jm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
