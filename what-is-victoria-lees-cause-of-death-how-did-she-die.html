How did she die?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Victoria Lee, an upcoming MMA fighter, died on 26th December 2022, per an announcement by her sister, Angela. Lee signed with One Championship in September 2020 and won the Atomweight title by defeating Sunisa Srisan in the second round in late February 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Nicknamed ‘The Prodigy’, Victoria defended her title twice, defeating Wang Luping and Victoria Souza. Lee took a break from fighting after her September 2021 win over Souza to focus on school. She was scheduled to face Zeba Bano of India on 14th January 2023 and was widely expected to defend her crown.&nbsp;</p><h3>Victoria Lee’s cause of death hasn’t been released, but her sister’s message suggests she committed suicide</h3><p>Victoria Lee’s family hasn’t released her cause of death. However, Angela’s announcement suggests that Lee committed suicide. The conclusion of Angela’s message reads:</p><p>“Please give our family grace and respect during this most difficult time. And please, check on your loved ones. Keep checking on them. Give them hugs and tell them how much they mean to you. You just never know.”</p><p>Angela referred to Victoria as ‘the most beautiful soul who ever lived’. She said the family would never be the same after Victoria’s passing. Angela wrote:</p><p>“She has gone too soon and our family has been completely devastated since then. We miss her. More than anything in this world. Our family will never be the same. Life will never be the same. We’re all broken. Because a piece of you was in each of us and when you left, those pieces were ripped out of us.”</p><p>The people using Lee’s death to spread the anti-vax agenda have faced widespread backlash. @wrestlejamia tweeted:&nbsp;“Disgusting amount of people using the Victoria Lee situation to push their agendas about vaccines when an official cause of death has never been announced. The world’s an awful place.”</p><p>Read Next: How did Kevin Lemons die?
