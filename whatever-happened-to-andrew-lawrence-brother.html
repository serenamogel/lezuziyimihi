Some of his acting credits&nbsp;in&nbsp;his adult years have been playing characters Jason in "United States of Tara," Eric in "Hawaii Five-0" and Ritchie in "Confessions of a Womanizer." Andy has also stepped behind the camera and directed movies in which he and his family members were part of the cast. In 2021, he directed the thriller "A Deadly Deed,"&nbsp;which starred Andy, his brothers, <a href=#>Matthew Lawrence</a> and Joey Lawrence, and <a href=#>Joey's wife, Samantha Cope</a>. Two years later, the same group again joined forces for another flick directed by Andy,&nbsp;"Mistletoe Mixup,"&nbsp;and in 2023, Andy, Joey, and Cope appeared onscreen in&nbsp;"Frankie Meets Jack," a rom-com&nbsp;Andy likewise directed.</p><p>During a 2020 interview with<a href=#>&nbsp;Flickering Myth</a>, Andy opened up about the genesis of his passion for behind-the-scenes roles. "I always got a kick out of working with the different departments, even as a kid," Andy said. He&nbsp;added, "I always loved doing that â€” communicating and collaborating with the different departments." Furthermore, Andy has shown his talent as a musician. In 2021, he took to&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;to share a then-new track of his called "I Can't Stop." Now,&nbsp;Andy's working alongside his two older siblings for a new collaboration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampka4V5fI6wn5qslauys3nHmqepnZ6asW7AzmaYp5yimsRuuMCwqZ6mk5p6o77OrZ%2Beql8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
