itemprop=articleBody><p><span>Debby Clarke Belichick was Bill Belichick’s wife;&nbsp;an American football coach who is currently the head coach of the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL).&nbsp;She is one of the few women who rose to fame after marrying celebrities, as her marriage to Bill was a case in point.&nbsp;Things went smoothly for the duo until they called it quits in 2004, despite being college sweethearts.</span></p><p><span>As they say, nothing breaks a relationship more than infidelity, Bill played a fast on his wife and got a cut of his coin.&nbsp;Many thought her divorce would break Debby, but she has proven otherwise as she has emerged as a very successful businesswoman.&nbsp;Here’s everything you should know about them.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Bio – Who Is Debby Clarke Belichick, Bill Belichick’s Ex-Wife?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Born as Debby Clarke but later adopted the name Debby Clarke Belichick after her union with her ex-husband Bill Belichick.&nbsp;Quiet and reserved Debby was born in 1955 in Nashville, Tennessee.&nbsp;She is white and American.</span></p><p><span>Debby Clarke Belichick became known as her ex-husband;&nbsp;Bill Belichick is a well-known personality in the football industry.&nbsp;Bill Belichick is the head coach of the New England Patriots in the NFL.&nbsp;He abides by his rules and is not a member of the NFL Coaching Association, although he has served in his capacity for a long time.</span></p><p><span>Assumptions might lead us to believe that if Debby weren’t married to Bill, she would have lived her private life as details of her parents, education and childhood have been expunged from the files.&nbsp;Still, we know that Debby Clarke Belichick is her own boss.&nbsp;She has had good business and is co-founder of The Art of Tile & Stone shop in Wellesley.</span></p><h3><strong><span>Her marriage to Bill Belichick and her divorce</span></strong></h3><p><span>Debby Clarke Belichick walked down the aisle with her college sweetheart Bill Belichick in 1977, but never knew their union with three beautiful children would only last 28 years.</span></p><p><span>Of course things went smoothly for them, you could say they had it all, a wonderful source of income, children and happiness.&nbsp;But it never lasted when their marital crisis began when Bill didn’t take his eyes off Sharon Shenocca, the former receptionist for the New York Giants.&nbsp;His affair with Sharon began after she split from her husband Vincent Shenocca.&nbsp;After that, Bill bought her a home worth over $2.2 million.&nbsp;Little did he know that the affair would cost his real family and also end his marriage.</span></p><p><span>Previously, Bill was linked to LindaJupiter Florida Holiday.&nbsp;He met her in a club and started an affair with her.&nbsp;The relationship was not rumored as they were spotted individually later during the week leading up to&nbsp;</span><span>Super Bowl XLII</span><span>&nbsp;.</span></p><p><span>By 2004, Debby and Bill couldn’t stand each other and finally decided to take a break while processing their divorce.&nbsp;Due to the way things had gone, their divorce was not easy to finalize as it took two years before it was made official.</span></p><p><span>It’s no secret that Debby Clarke Belichick has kept a very low profile and is currently single, while her ex-husband Bill Belichick has long since joined Linda Holiday.&nbsp;Bill has publicized his relationship with Linda heavily, he uploads various pictures of it on his social media platforms.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family: children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Debby and Bill may have divorced and put their union behind them, too, but they wouldn’t deny that their marriage vows have produced children who are daily reminders of their togetherness.&nbsp;They were blessed with three children – two boys and one girl, namely Stephen, Brian and Amanda.</span></p><p><span>The children followed their father’s path as athletes and they are doing well too.&nbsp;Stephen, Brain and Amanda all took an interest in the game of lacrosse and did so well.</span></p><p><span>Bill and Debby’s first and only daughter, Amanda, graduated from Wesleyan University in 2007 and was an active lacrosse player at school.&nbsp;She mastered the game and was hired as a lacrosse coach for Connecticut prep school.&nbsp;She also worked in the school’s recording unit.&nbsp;She then served as an interim women’s coach at Wesleyan University and later became an assistant coach on the University of Massachusetts Amherst women’s lacrosse team.&nbsp;She also served as the lacrosse coach for Ohio State Buckeyes and was named head coach of the women’s lacrosse team at Holy Cross College in 2005.</span></p><p><span>Her first son Stephen was also doing surprisingly well at the game of lacrosse, but he’s also adept at soccer.&nbsp;He received a scholarship to Rutgers University and graduated.&nbsp;After graduating, he was named an assistant coach of the New England Patriots in May 2012.&nbsp;He then became the team’s safety coach in 2016.</span></p><p><span>Brian, her last son, became engaged to the game of lacrosse as well.&nbsp;He was an active player during his Trinity College days.&nbsp;He later became the Assistant Boy Scout for the Patriots Front Office in college.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
