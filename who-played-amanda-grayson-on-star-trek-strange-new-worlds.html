She faces countless challenges as a human member of Vulcan society, which shuns displays of outward emotion or affection.</p><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>As with many elements of the original series – including Spock himself – the character of Amanda Grayson returned in the prequel series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Trek: Discovery</a>. Since then, Amanda has been played by Canadian actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mia Kirshner</a>, best known for her roles as Jenny in The L Word, Mandy in 24, and Isobel in The Vampire Diaries. Kirshner first appeared as the character in Discovery‘s “Lethe,” and then went on to feature prominently in the show’s second season.</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>Her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">latest appearance</a> in Strange New Worlds had her attempting to guide Spock through a complicated Vulcan pre-marriage ritual, exacerbated by Spock suddenly losing his Vulcan half due to the intervention of strange aliens. This left him without his usual self-control, and forced him to rely on his mother’s experience with navigating Vulcan social norms as a human. The deep bond between her and Spock was the highlight of the episode.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Outside of acting, Kirshner has published the book <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I Live Here</a>, which compiles the life stories of four groups of refugees from Chechnya, Juárez, Burma, and Malawi. Kirshner was also invited by MIT to run a four-week course based around the book’s content.</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>With the character’s return in Strange New Worlds so warmly received, it’s likely she may appear again in future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mp6WZqZqxbq3MmqWdmV2cv6LF0qilZqeeYsC1rdFmq6udm2LAtb7Ap56eZZ6axG7Dzqujnatf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
