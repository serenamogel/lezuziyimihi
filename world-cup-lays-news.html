Do you remember the novelty of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">garlic bread-flavored potato chips</a> and the wonder of Chicken & Waffles Lay’s? Do you remember when that was a form of entertainment? Do you remember when phones were iPods and iPods were CDs and CDs were tapes and tapes were records? Do you remember…the 21st night of September?</p><p>What I’m trying to say is that Lay’s is releasing three limited-edition flavors this fall in honor of the FIFA World Cup, which is taking place in Qatar from November 20 through December 18, 2022 (instead of during the&nbsp;summer like usual). So dust off your cleats and that trademark 2013 sense of wonder over funky potato chip flavors, and let’s get a FIFA what these chip flavors are.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-what-are-the-world-cup-lay-s-flavors>So what are the World Cup Lay’s flavors?&nbsp;</h2><p>Let me tell you, they are giving us quite an array from all over the footballin’ world (though really just the U.S. and Mexico). We are getting Adobadas flavored Lay’s which will contain “a combination of chili, tomato and lime” to represent the Mexican marinated pork dish/marinade; Bacon Wrapped Jalapeño Popper, a “combination of jalapeño and smoky BBQ” to represent the U.S.; and Lay’s Wavy Carnitas Street Tacos, which promise a “rich taco-style pork carnitas flavor.” Real Lay’s heads will recall that the brand released Carnitas Street Taco-flavored chips <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">back in 2020</a> as part of the Flavor Icons collection; likewise, the Bacon Wrapped Jalapeño flavor has been in stores <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a few times since 2017</a>. And Adobadas is a regular offering from Mexican snack brand Sabritas (which is owned by PepsiCo along with Frito-Lay). All three flavors <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">are set to hit stores</a> this month. You better believe I’m making it a goooooooooooooooooooal for myself to try all three.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2Bfp7mlecKup2akka7AbrrEsKpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
