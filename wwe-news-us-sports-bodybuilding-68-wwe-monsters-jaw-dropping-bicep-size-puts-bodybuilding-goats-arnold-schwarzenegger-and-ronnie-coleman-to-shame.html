With huge pecs, biceps, quads, and traps, Schwarzenegger was a true bodybuilding icon. Similar to him, Hulk Hogan in WWE also boasted one of the biggest biceps.</p><p>In the current era, another superstar who could be a match for Schwarzenegger is The Monster Among Men, Braun Strowman.

However, one shocking thing which came out of it and struck the fan’s eyes was Strowman’s biceps size.</p><p>Strowman flexed a massive biceps size of 25 inches, even bigger than Hulk Hogan. Even bodybuilding legend Ronnie Coleman fell short of Strowman’s biceps with just 23 inches. While Schwarzenegger is a seven-time Mr. Olympia, Coleman is an eight-time Mr. Olympia. However, Strowman is neither.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-wwe-news-us-sports-bodybuilding-4-time-mr-olympia-jay-cutler-gave-a-stinging-response-to-wwe-legend-triple-h-when-asked-about-ronnie-coleman?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Rone-Coleman-560x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">4-Time Mr. Olympia Jay Cutler Gave a Stinging Response to WWE Legend Triple H When Asked About Ronnie Coleman</p></a><p>The 6’8″ monster’s jaw-dropping biceps are a tough match for these legends and can easily put them to shame.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Who has bigger biceps between Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dwayne Johnson, and John Cena?</h2><p>Dwayne Johnson started as a football player before joining WWE and then Hollywood.
