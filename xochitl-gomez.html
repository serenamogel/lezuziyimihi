She went on to appear in 22 full-length musicals. Her acting resumé also includes commercials, film work and television roles. At 12, she played Dawn Schafer in a Netflix reboot of "The Baby-Sitters Club." In 2020, Gomez landed the role of Marvel superhero America Chavez for the film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Chavez, who made her first comics appearance in 2011, is a queer Latina.

Her parents are of Mexican descent—her father is from Morelos, Mexico, and her mother is from Los Angeles—and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://peopleenespanol.com/chica/doctor-strange-xochitl-gomez-america-chavez-marvel/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="spoke Spanish" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">spoke Spanish</a> at home.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Growing up, Gomez played with other kids of Mexican heritage and had a Mexican babysitter. However, she didn't see her world reflected in the media she consumed. "I grew up rarely seeing girls on-screen that looked like me or shared my culture," she told Teen Vogue in 2022.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Start as an Actress</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gomez started acting at age 5 when her mother enrolled her in a musical theater class. The first production she appeared in was The Little Mermaid. "I absolutely loved being on stage," she said of the experience.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the time she was 12, Gomez had been in 22 full-length musicals. She began trying out for commercials at the age of 10. Her early credits also include approximately 13 student films.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"My mom would drive me around L.A. for hours every day after school, taking me to auditions. Sometimes we would have like four or five a day, it was crazy," Gomez said of her mother, who was very supportive of her acting. As Gomez became busier, her mother quit her job to be more available for her daughter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2019, Gomez landed a lead role as Dawn Schafer on Netflix's reboot of "The Baby-Sitters Club."

"Latina girls tell me that they finally see someone who looks like them on TV and that it means so much," she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.themarysue.com/xochitl-gomez-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=shared class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">shared</a> in a 2020 interview.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In February 2020, Gomez auditioned for an upcoming Marvel project, though she felt she was unlikely to get the role since the character was 18 and she was just 13 at the time. At her second audition six months later, Gomez learned that the character had been made younger and<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/doctor-strange-2-benedict-wong-and-xochitl-gomez-discuss-film-1235141395/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" believed" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> believed</a> she now stood a better chance at landing the role.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gomez prepared for the second audition by adding kickboxing and stunt training to a workout regimen that already included martial arts.

She became the first Mexican-American teen to play a superhero in the Marvel cinematic universe.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gomez told People en Español that she was delighted to embody the character. "She is a powerful, smart, charismatic, queer Latina. The fact that she is on the screen and is important to the story will make people feel seen in a way that they have never been. I am waiting for the day when this kind of representation is so normal."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gomez was 14 during filming, the same age as the character she was playing. She held her own in scenes with stars like Cumberbatch, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/elizabeth-olsen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elizabeth Olsen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Elizabeth Olsen</a> and Benedict Wong.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The one downside to the role was it left Gomez unable to appear in the second season of "The Baby-Sitters Club." The series was being made in Canada at the same time the movie was filming in England, and the COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible to fly between the two countries.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Social Media</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In Multiverse of Madness, Chavez's two mothers appear in one scene.

However, her connection to the content led to online vitriol, and her TikTok account was temporarily banned. "I got my TikTok back and I posted a TikTok because I know that I do have a very strong young following," Gomez explained. "So I thought it was only right to post a TikTok of [me saying] nothing can break me down, I'm going to stay strong, just keep going because it's very important for young teenagers to have a positive person to look up to."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gomez can be seen dancing on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.tiktok.com/@_xochitl.gomez?lang=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=TikTok class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">TikTok</a> and on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/_xochitl.gomez/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Instagram class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Instagram</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Movies and TV Shows</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to her roles on "The Baby-Sitters Club" and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Gomez also had a role on Netflix's 'Gentefied' (2020). In addition, she has appeared on the show 'You're the Worst' (2014), the action movie Shadow Wolves (2019) and the romantic film Roped (2020).</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Future Plans</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gomez intends to continue working in the entertainment industry. "I want to achieve directing, writing, editing and acting on a film or TV. I know I have to start now, writing tiny movies and start on that,” she said in 2020.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2022, she reflected on her goals. "I've been thinking about what all the other Marvel actors have done, like indie movies, but also large stage movies too. I'm thinking about following in their footsteps, but I do have some ideas for music videos that I'd like to shoot for artists that I really like just because lots of the directors that I like started in music videos. So, that just seems like a good way to start. Also just through TikTok, I'm like directing my own dance videos and montages. I find so much joy in that."</p><ul data-node-id=35 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 2006</li><li>Birth date: April 29, 2006</li><li>Birth State: California</li><li>Birth City: Los Angeles</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Best Known For: American actress Xochitl Gomez portrayed Marvel superhero America Chavez in the 2022 film 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.'</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Film</li><li>Television</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Taurus</li><li>Nacionalities</li><li>Interesting Facts</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Gomez is dyslexic and closely studies her dialogue to guard against mistakes during auditions and filming.</li><li>Gomez started studying martial arts around the age of 12 and is on her way to becoming a black belt.</li></ul><li>Occupations</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=38><ul data-node-id=40 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Xochitl Gomez Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actors/xochitl-gomez</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: July 27, 2022</li><li>Original Published Date: July 27, 2022</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp3y5u8KhoK2kXZy8rrHZ</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
