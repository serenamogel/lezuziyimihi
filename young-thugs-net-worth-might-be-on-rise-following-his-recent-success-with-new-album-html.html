Among them, the song Solid with Drake is currently the track that is skyrocketing the charts.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Currently, the track claims the crown of #1 on Apple Music, both USA, and Global. On Spotify, it’s in the top 10s and is pulling in over 900k plays daily. It is an easy <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suspicion</a> that it will soon go up.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The track features the Midas touch of Drake, who comes in with casual jabs and hooks that give the track ease like no one else could. While the song is simple in structure with standard trap beats and loops, the swaying 808s and an interesting hang drum that comes into accent the single makes it an ideal song to listen to with eyes closed.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Gunna’s signature trap style of rapping sets the mood of the song, and as he trades bars with Drake, it adds variety both appropriately and adequately. And because of Young Thug’s song, he comes in at the end and blows the competition out of the water.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As of today, along with Solid, his five more songs have landed themselves in the Top 10 Songs in Apple Music. Ski, Diamond, Proud of You, Came and Saw and Paid the Fine hold third, fourth, ninth, and tenth position respectively. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Thug’s Net Worth To Go Up</h2><p>Thug’s net worth currently stands at $8 million, which he has been amassing for himself before he was the age of 20. Now, at age 29, he not only has the “macaroni and cheese but also the sides” with accolades from MTV, American Music Awards, and the Grammy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>That aside, it is also important to acknowledge how that is predicted to shoot up after this album. The Wall Street Journal <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> Apple pays 52% of the revenue from subscriptions to all the record labels. That comes down to about 52 cents per dollar.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Spotify, which gets revenue from both subscriptions and ads in the free tier, pays two-thirds of every dollar to the rights holders, with labels getting at least 75% from the deal. That comes down to about 50 cents for every play. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>With these in mind, that’s a lot for Young Thug and his label, almost garnering close to $900k a day from these major music distributors in gross amounts. This is solely from the streaming services, which <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">makes </a>about 80% of today’s listening audience.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Then, there are the other songs which to have charted to acknowledge in the mix. There are also platforms like YouTube, and royalties from radio plays to consider as well, which add to this already huge payoff.</p><p>Besides the albums, there’s also a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">merch store</a> from his label and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ticket sales</a> that are eagerly waiting to fly off the shelves when the regulations drop and concerts and tours become a thing again. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>With all the success, Young Thug’s net worth is bound to shoot up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGikrquZmLaiuo6ypq6ml2LBqcHGrGSnnaRixLC%2B06FkpqGXncFursRmpqdlop7ApnnFqKOlp6eeu6h5x6KqZqqVmLKvwIysrJyblajAbsPIrZ9mppWseqK4wa6kZ6Ckork%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
